<h1> Brotherhood of Steel </h1>

<div class="container">
    <div class="text-block">
        <p> The Brotherhood of Steel (commonly abbreviated to BoS) is a post-War technology-focused paramilitary order with chapters operating across the territory of the former United States of America. It was founded by rogue U.S. Army officer Captain Roger Maxson shortly after the Great War. </p>
        <p> The Brotherhood's original purpose was to preserve advanced technology and regulate its usage. This is because they believe humanity cannot be trusted with the means to destroy itself, and they acquire technology to prevent another apocalypse. Although they tend to be relatively isolationist, the Brotherhood has proved to be one of the most important organizations in the history of the wasteland, though their power, influence, and doctrine vary heavily from chapter to chapter. </p>

        <h2> History/Research Findings </h2>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> The Mariposa Rebellion </h3>
        <p> In 2076, the NBC division of West Tek achieved breakthrough results in the Pan-Immunity Virion Project. The United States Defense Department, fearing international espionage, moved a military team under the command of Colonel Robert Spindel and Captain Roger Maxson onto the site to secure and oversee the project, now dubbed the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) project. On January 7, 2077, all FEV research was moved to the newly constructed Mariposa Military Base to commence testing of the virus on human subjects. The security team was transferred to the newly constructed base as well, to provide protection for the research going on within the facility. They were not informed of the nature of the research. </p>

    <div class="text-block">
        <p> The situation unraveled shortly before October 10, 2077. The soldiers stationed at Mariposa discovered the fact that the scientists under their care were performing experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus on military prisoners. The revelation prompted a nervous breakdown in Colonel Spindel, who locked himself in his office. Captain Maxson was the only officer left to handle the deteriorating situation. Soldiers were screaming for blood and the whole situation was at risk of devolving into a bloodbath. On October 12, when Maxson had to step in to prevent one of his subordinates from killing a member of the science team, he ordered interrogations of the science team under his authority as acting commander. He hoped to prevent a full mutiny by offering his troops a semblance of justice. </p>
        <p> The first scientist was brought before Maxson a day later, on October 13. Chief Researcher Robert Anderson explained that human experiments at the facility were sanctioned by the government. He outlined the program to the captain, emphasizing the fact that it was the government that ordered it. When Maxson refused to believe him, the scientist lost his nerve and started screaming how he was just following orders and that he was a military man just like Maxson. The captain shot him in response. He rationalized it as trying to prevent a full-scale mutiny, but even he did not believe it. </p>
        <p> The killing of Robert Anderson effectively established Maxson as the leader of the rebellion. His position was further reinforced just two days later on October 15, when he attempted to speak to Colonel Spindel through the door of his office. It soon became clear that the colonel had lost touch with reality, so Maxson and several of his men broke down the door just in time to hear the colonel apologize and shoot himself. Subsequent scientist interrogations invariably ended in executions. Erin Shellman held out the longest by October 18, finally convincing the captain that the experiments were really ordered by the government with her detailed account. On October 20, 2077, Captain Maxson declared his unit in full secession from the United States over the radio, attempting to force the government to respond to the situation at Mariposa. No response came. A day later, he ordered the families of soldiers under his command to take shelter within the facility. </p>
        <p> On October 23, 2077, the Great War struck. As Maxson was halfway through prying the story from Head Researcher Leon Von Felden, the facility lost contact with the outside world as nuclear weapons started to drop. Spared the nuclear devastation, Mariposa protected the inhabitants from nuclear fallout flooding the wasteland. Fearing that China would soon make up for the oversight, on October 24, Maxson ordered his soldiers and their families to prepare to vacate the base the next day. </p>
        <p> On October 25, Sergeant Platner volunteered to take atmospheric readings outside the base. Reporting no significant amounts of radiation in the atmosphere, final preparations for the Exodus were undertaken. On October 26, Maxson ordered the remains of the scientists to be buried in the wastes outside the base. A day later, on October 27, former US servicemen and their families left the base under the lead of Captain Roger Maxson, heading for the Lost Hills government bunker in the south. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> The Exodus </h3>
        <p> In November, a few weeks later, war refugees arrived at the bunker. The people suffered casualties along the way, as while the soldiers were protected by T-51 power armor, their families had no armor to speak of. Marauders that attacked the caravan quickly learned to target the unprotected civilians. Though the attackers paid with two lives for every one they took, many were lost, including Roger Maxson's wife but not his teenage son. </p>
        <p> Several soldiers broke off during the Exodus as well, led by Sergeant Dennis Allen. Ignoring warnings from Captain Maxson and defying the group's will, Allen's faction separated from the convoy in order to excavate the remains of the West Tek Research Facility using their power armor. They were never heard from again. Around 2151, the Brotherhood sent out knights to seek out Allen's group or its remains. All they found were desolate ruins. </p>
        <p> The Exodus survivors claimed the Lost Hills bunker as their own. The refugees expanded and adapted it to fit their own needs, becoming a bastion of technology in a world that has lost centuries of technological development overnight. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> Foundation of the Brotherhood and expansion in Appalachia </h3>
        <p> Using surviving satellite connections, Maxson reached out across the continent, broadcasting a request for contact. By chance, Maxson found an old friend in Appalachia, Lieutenant Elizabeth Taggerdy of the US Army Rangers. Although initially hesitant to trust him, due to the public declaration of secession, she gambled and left the channel open. As Maxson revealed the depth of atrocities perpetrated by the United States government, Taggerdy's faith in the system was shaken, then dismantled. Following the winter spent at Camp Venture, she joined Maxson's banner. </p>
        <p> Witnessing how people around him slowly succumbed to depression, Captain Maxson formulated a new ideology for the survivors. It took him years to create it, replacing the tarnished Stars and Stripes with new symbols, new ranks, and new ideas to replace the ones scorched in nuclear fire. They would provide meaning for people before they became lost in the depths of despair after losing their friends, family, and their entire world. Although some under his command, particularly Lieutenant Taggerdy, were skeptical of his plans, Maxson believed that the way forward lay in new traditions and a new mythology, free of the burden of the past. He also believed that it would prevent any surviving politicians from exercising their authority over former American soldiers, especially those with an agenda that involved burning Americans on the funeral pyre of the regime. By June 20, 2082, all members under his command switched over to using Brotherhood ranks and practices. </p>
        <p> The Brotherhood kept growing in New California, welcoming into its ranks a National Guard unit that was formerly stationed near Mariposa. They acquired several bunkers and sent expeditions as far as the Mojave Wasteland, gathering intelligence and new recruits. As the Brotherhood in New California developed, so did its sister organization in Appalachia under Paladin Taggerdy. Although she showed a bias towards candidates with a military background while building up the ranks, she eventually understood Roger Maxson's vision and continued to expand and develop the organization using Camp Venture as a training outpost. Despite initial resistance to the new rank system by the rest in her outfit, the new ideas offered by Maxson eventually took root and were accepted. </p>
        <p> In Appalachia, the Brotherhood's insistence on acquiring munitions for their fighting against mutants led to ruffled feathers, especially with the Responders prior to the Christmas Flood in December 2082. However, they eventually found a common tongue, standing together during the Battle of Huntersville against super mutants in May 2086. Although the Brotherhood sustained losses, it prevailed. This coincided with the announcement of a new mandate by Roger Maxson at Lost Hills: to gather, record, and save the collective knowledge of mankind for future generations, to act as a catalyst for the rebirth of civilization in time. Some in Appalachia responded to this new policy with enthusiasm, others with grudging acceptance, and yet others, like Hank Madigan, left the Brotherhood to join the Responders. </p>
        <p> The new mission quickly took a backseat, however, as the Appalachian Brotherhood encountered the scorchbeasts and the Scorched in the Cranberry Bog. Conferring with Maxson's ace researcher at Lost Hills, Scribe Hailey Takano, the Brotherhood in Appalachia quickly calculated that the scorchbeasts represented a potential extinction event for humanity. Lost Hills supplied a number of designs and weapon schematics to help stem the tide, including a sonic generator and an automated research program. Taggerdy pleaded with Maxson to grant her team permission to use nuclear weapons against the scorchbeasts but was forbidden by him because he found the concept of using nuclear weapons, even to help fight the scorchbeasts, to be too morally abhorrent after their world was destroyed by nukes. </p>
        <p> By the 2090s, communication between Lost Hills and Appalachia was on steady decline due to failing Old World communication infrastructure. Before being cut off, Maxson ordered Taggerdy to hold the tide, and proscribed the use of nuclear weapons. Eventually, the communications failed entirely, separating Lost Hills from Appalachia. The chapter in Appalachia fought on, trying to destroy the scorchbeasts through attrition, but by 2093, their numbers dwindled to the point where they were forced to close down Camp Venture, their first base, and focus their remaining forces at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain Power Plant. Declining support from the Responders and the constant fighting just to stem the tide of the Scorched and their masters took their toll, preventing the Brotherhood from completing the automated research program at Vault-Tec University, supplied to them by Takano. </p>
        <p> Eventually, the Brotherhood launched Operation Touchdown. This last ditch effort was launched in January 2095 and briefly stemmed the tide at the cost of the entire strike force, which included Knight Moreno and Paladin Taggerdy. Ultimately, the Brotherhood in Appalachia was wiped out in their last stand at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain on August 18-19, 2095, marking the end of the original Brotherhood in Appalachia with Vernon Dodge as the only survivor. </p>
        <h3> Reinforcements arrive in Appalachia </h3>
        <p> However, by 2103, a small group of reinforcements arrived on their way from Lost Hills to examine various centers of technology across the country, expand the Brotherhood across the East Coast, and find out what happened to Taggerdy. Known as the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force, they were led by Leila Rahmani and Daniel Shin and were to set up base in Fort Atlas in Appalachia. The team also had a scribe named Odessa Valdez. While Maxson's motive was sincere, wishing to find out what happened to his friend Taggerdy, Rahmani became certain the Council of Elders had an ulterior motive: to remove her influence and meddling as she would often argue over their ways. </p>
        <p> Along their hike across the country, the expedition found a town under threat by raiders. Wanting to assist them, Rahmani and Shin agreed to providing the townsfolk with weapons to help defend them. Unfortunately, the raiders were able to steal the guns and kill the townsfolk. During the assault, the Brotherhood lost one of their valued members, Alan Connors, and obtained two young refugee siblings who lost their parents, Marcia and Maximo Leone. This incident would set off a division between Rahmani and Shin, with Shin wanting himself and Rahmani to stand trial with the Council of Elders. </p>
        <p> Upon arriving in Appalachia, the group was dismayed to discover that Taggerdy's Brotherhood was wiped out by the scorchbeasts, with Vernon Dodge being the only known survivor. Rahmani decided that in order to establish the Brotherhood's presence in the region, the organization needed to cooperate with Appalachia's other factions, particularly the settlement of Foundation. Shin became skeptical of Rahmani's choices, particularly her desire to delay the re-establishment of contact with the elders in Lost Hills. Rahmani and Shin dealt with numerous conflicts including trying to assist the Retreat from a cruel woman named Dagger, negotiating with Meg Groberg's raiders, trying to reclaim property taken by Foundation, and investigating a missing caravan. </p>
        <p> During a mission to explore an Enclave research facility, Rahmani, feeling that the elders from Lost Hills were a hindrance in her ideals of establishing the Brotherhood as a peacekeeping force, destroyed the radio transmitter, which infuriated Shin. As a result, there is no confirmation of the Brotherhood in Appalachia re-establishing contact with the Brotherhood in California, as well as their status post-2105. Despite the internal conflict between Rahmani and Shin, the Brotherhood was able to repel an uprise of super mutants. They also stopped a plan to infect the water cycle with FEV orchestrated by a driven scientist. However, it is also unclear if Rahmani remained the Appalachian Brotherhood's leader or if Shin usurped her. </p>
        <p> The Brotherhood kept a degree of expansion and surveillance over the years, with members tightly patrolling Appalachia in order to ensure safety. For example, Nicole Gaines would investigate and erect Forward Station Tango. A mechanic working for Valdez, Del Lawson, worked to supply equipment for any Brotherhood field operations. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> Conflict with the Vipers </h3>
        <p> In 2135, Roger Maxson died of cancer. Already a legendary figure to the Brotherhood, he was essentially deified as the Founder and Deliverer. His son, Maxson II, replaced him as the high elder, while his grandson, John Maxson, joined the paladin caste, showing great promise. Around 2141, the Brotherhood ceased admitting new members from the outside, relying solely on their natural growth for increasing their numbers. </p>
        <p> The Brotherhood was a major power in the region at this point, firmly exercising their control on the lands surrounding their bunker and forming trade relations with the neighboring towns, especially the Hub. However, the focus on hard sciences gave in to the detriment of humanities, history in particular. This decline in soft sciences eventually led to some initiates of the youngest generations having no idea who Roger Maxson was. In 2150, they clashed with the newly reformed Vipers. The battles intensified in subsequent years, culminating in the death of High Elder Maxson II in 2155. John Maxson's father expected the raiders to break formation and flee when faced with Brotherhood warriors clad in powered armor, but did not account for their religious ferocity. A poisoned arrow nicked him when his helmet was off, and he died within hours. John Maxson was promoted to the elder council, while Rhombus was tasked with conducting a campaign of extermination against the Vipers. The paladins tracked down and wiped out almost all of their members within the span of a month. A handful of Vipers were able to flee north and east into the mountain range; while small groups continued to exist and raid in New California, they never regained their full power. Both Rhombus and John Maxson would eventually ascend to leadership roles, with John Maxson becoming the high elder in 2159 and promoting Rhombus to the role of head paladin. </p>
        <p> During the campaign, the Brotherhood sent a few scouts and emissaries to the Hub to track down Vipers members, and from these beginnings, the Hub and the Brotherhood began full trade relations. Caravans had delivered to the Brotherhood before, but not long after the destruction of the Vipers, caravan trains ran directly from the Hub to the Brotherhood on a regular basis. While the situation remained peaceful and prosperous, issues would develop between the Hub and the Brotherhood from time to time. In the late 2150s, the water merchants of the Hub attempted to barter a large quantity of water for a weapons stockpile. Although the Brotherhood turned down the offer, the merchants attempted to take the weapons regardless. The thieves were caught, but the Brotherhood elders voted down a retaliatory expedition. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> The emergence of the Unity </h3>
        <p> In 2161, the Brotherhood discovered the presence of a new enemy. In October, a group of knights on a patrol in the badlands discovered a dead super mutant. After examining the creature, Head Scribe Vree determined that it was sterile, but also notes that there must have been a central location that created these mutants. The elder council, fearing a potential invasion, enacted several security decrees, including a moratorium on training new recruits until the threat passed. </p>
        <p> The elders also sent out several scouts north and east into the badlands. Only one returned from the east, reporting an encounter with twenty super mutants, and none at all returned from the north. The council could not reach an agreement on how to act. Even as Hub merchant caravans started disappearing in the northern wastes, the elders refused to act until they were fully certain that there was an army massing in the northern mountains. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> Apex of power, stagnation, and recovery </h3>
        <p> Following the destruction of the Unity, the Brotherhood aided other human settlements to drive the mutants away with minimal loss of life on both sides of the conflict. The Brotherhood remained out of the power structure for a time, becoming a major research and development house by reintroducing advanced technology into New California at a slow pace. The wise guidance of Rhombus arguably brought the Brotherhood to the zenith of its power. The Brotherhood had good relations with the developing New California Republic, to the point that one of the states of the federation was named after the founder of the Brotherhood: Maxson. However, Lost Hills was never incorporated into the NCR. </p>
        <p> Over the years, the Brotherhood grew confident in its status as the sole source of advanced technology left to mankind, and allowed its prominence and influence to wane, growing stagnant. This stagnancy made them unable to deal with the technologically superior Enclave, when the Brotherhood learned of their existence circa 2240. In order to learn more about them, the Brotherhood reactivated a network of outposts in Northern California to observe Enclave activity. Thanks to their low profile, they achieved practical anonymity, even in the populous San Francisco. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> The Brotherhood heads East </h3>
        <p> Once the Enclave was believed to be destroyed (* it wasn't *), he Brotherhood was without a foe to face. In an effort to end the stagnation, the Brotherhood expanded eastward (including the formation of the Mojave chapter under Elder Elijah) and sent out expeditions to recover technology, going as far as the Capital Wasteland in 2255, with the expedition under Senior Paladin Owyn Lyons. A secondary goal was to re-establish contact with other wayward Brotherhood chapters. One of John Maxson's descendants, Arthur Maxson, was sent on this expedition both to protect him from internal conflict in the Western Brotherhood and as a means of receiving training from Lyons, who was then in favor with the Western elders. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> Earliest conflict with the Enclave </h3>
        <p> The Brotherhood of Steel first entered into conflict with the Enclave on the West Coast during the year 2241. As the Enclave began to reveal its presence to the post-nuclear world, the Brotherhood of Steel reopened several observation outposts in New California to monitor their activity and learn their motives. During this time period, the Brotherhood of Steel tasks an unkown (* but probably important *) figure with infiltrating Navarro Air Base and retrieving schematics for the Enclave's modified vertibird's. There are implications that clashes occurred between the two during the NCR-Brotherhood War. Following the events of Navarro's destruction at the hands of the NCR sometime after 2246, the Brotherhood of Steel openly began to hunt down and annihilate remnants of the Enclave on the West Coast. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> NCR-Brotherhood War </h3>
        <p> In the late 2250s to 2260s, the New California Republic's growth would eventually lead to a collision course with the Brotherhood. As the NCR's power grew, the Brotherhood adopted a policy of reclaiming technology from people outside the order, energy weapons most of all. The disagreements over the handling of technology eventually resulted in a full-out war with the New California Republic. The Brotherhood was eventually forced into a retreat. At least six Brotherhood bunkers were lost to the NCR, four of them destroyed by the Brotherhood themselves in a last-ditch attempt to deny them to the enemy. Despite gaining the upper hand over the Brotherhood, the NCR also suffered losses in manpower, materiel, and economy. The NCR's gold reserves were raided heavily by the Brotherhood, causing bank runs. The NCR switched to fiat money to prevent further crisis, but this led to inflation and loss of consumer confidence. </p>
        <p> One major confrontation occurred during the NCR's Operation: Sunburst in the Mojave Wasteland in 2276. Under Elder Elijah's leadership, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel was operating out of the solar power plant HELIOS One when the NCR launched an attack. The NCR's numerical superiority over the Brotherhood, coupled with Elder Elijah's immense reluctance to leave HELIOS, allowed the NCR to overwhelm the defenders, leading to the loss of over half the chapter. The NCR subsequently considered the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood to be effectively neutralized. The survivors of the Mojave chapter retreated to the Hidden Valley bunker, going under lockdown to prevent detection and bide time to recover. The chapter restricted its operations to recon patrols and occasional high-priority raids, all at night, using Hidden Valley's DERVISH camouflage system to mask their movements. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> Capital Wasteland </h3>
        <p> The Brotherhood's presence in the east suffered a further setback when Elder Owyn Lyons, head of the Capital Wasteland division, refused a direct order from the Lost Hills elder council, confirming their suspicions that he had gone rogue and was no longer pursuing the original mission. In response, the Brotherhood completely shut off communications to Lyons' division and denied them any reinforcements. </p>
        <p> By 2277, the Brotherhood was well-established in the Capital Wasteland, with their headquarters at the Citadel in Washington D.C. The Enclave, however, wanted to control Project Purity for themselves, leading to a conflict between the Brotherhood and the Enclave, culminating in the Battle of Project Purity. The Brotherhood were able to prevent the Enclave's assault using a giant combat robot called Liberty Prime. Although this was a short-term boon for the East Coast Brotherhood, changes were on the horizon for the chapter. </p>
        <h3 class="small"> Interim </h3>
        <p> The key blow to the Capital Wasteland division came sometime before August 2279, with the death of Owyn Lyons and the loss of now-Elder Sarah Lyons not long afterwards. With the seat of power emptied, the remaining Brotherhood members elected multiple ineffectual leaders. Meanwhile, the adolescent Squire Arthur Maxson matured into a capable warrior and tactician, eventually defeating Shepherd, the new war boss of the Capital Wasteland super mutants, around 2282. This feat earned him a provisional leadership position within the Capital Wasteland division. This position was bestowed by the West Coast elders, who revealed that they still monitored their errant brethren. </p>
        <p> Maxson's position solidified in 2283 when he negotiated a treaty with the Brotherhood Outcasts, bringing them back into the fold and reforming the entire organization, turning away from some of Lyons' humanitarian goals and restoring the original mission of the Brotherhood of Steel. While a few members found this distasteful and left, a majority still remained, proud to serve a refocused Brotherhood. Maxson became leader of the Brotherhood's Eastern branch, setting it on a new, more authoritarian path. Around this same time, the Brotherhood began constructing a massive airship known as the Prydwen at the conquered former Enclave facility of Adams Air Force Base; the ship began full operation in 2282. With it, the chapter began to project its presence across the wider East Coast. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> Mojave chapter </h3>
        <p> By 2281, the Mojave Brotherhood's lockdown in Hidden Valley continued in response to the NCR increasing its presence in the Mojave Wasteland five-fold since 2276. The Mojave chapter, according to Elder McNamara, had time to fully recuperate from their losses suffered from the battle at HELIOS One, although the isolation meant a portion of their new knights and paladins were not experienced in combat outside of virtual training simulators. Some of their first scouting missions revealed that the NCR's presence in the region had only increased in their absence, so the lockdown was extended. The Brotherhood used the time in lockdown to re-strategize when it came to facing the NCR. However, the lockdown was becoming untenable due to morale issues, as well as critical mechanical issues with the Hidden Valley bunker's air filtration. </p>
        <p> Though many within the NCR wrote them off as a spent force, Colonel Cassandra Moore still considered the Brotherhood to be a threat. Similar strategic assessments were made by the other major players in the region: Caesar believed they would have to be dealt with eventually, before or after the Legion's victory over the NCR; Robert House also sought to eliminate the Brotherhood's survivors, seeing them as the next-greatest obstacle to his plans after the NCR and the Legion. Yes Man's calculations also predicted that the Brotherhood would be the biggest enemy to anyone attempting to form an independent New Vegas. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> Conflict with the Institute </h3>
        <p> The Brotherhood first sent a recon team into the Commonwealth in 2280. They were extremely successful, finding troves of pre-War documents and advanced technology. The second, Artemis, was a failure; its members were killed off in engagements with various hostiles, with the lone survivor, Paladin Brandis, going into hiding. The third recon team, Gladius, also fared poorly, with their numbers whittled down to three by various threats. The surviving trio of Gladius have made their base at Cambridge Police Station and seek to carry out their mission as best as possible and re-establish communication with the Citadel to report their most concerning findings about the region. </p>
        <p> The Brotherhood in the Capital Wasteland eventually received Gladius' message and deployed in force; the message evidenced the existence of the Institute, a scientific cabal which the Brotherhood deemed dangerous to humanity. The Brotherhood sent a full combat expedition led by Elder Maxson, comprised of the Prydwen and a fleet of accompanying Vertibirds, with the main objective of seeking out and destroying the Institute. In the subsequent war for the Commonwealth, the Brotherhood may have also entered conflict with the Railroad and/or the Commonwealth Minutemen, other regional powers. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> Cold fusion conflict in Los Angeles </h3>
        <p> By 2296, the Brotherhood as an organization had splintered into dozens of individual chapters across the wastes, with the Commonwealth chapter maintaining primacy over the overall chapter hierarchy. The Commonwealth chapter received intelligence on an Enclave defector, Siggi Wilzig, who possessed a vital piece of technology that was of interest to the Brotherhood. </p>
        <p> A West Coast chapter known as the Knights of San Fernando -- a chapter noted to have a particularly religious adherence to Brotherhood ideology -- was tasked by the Commonwealth chapter with joining the manhunt for Wilzig, with a Prydwen-class airship traveling to the airbase used as the chapter's headquarters to assist in their hunt. Knight Titus and Squire Maximus were among those charged with leading this manhunt, assigned to search the area around Filly in greater Los Angeles. After Titus' death, Thaddeus joined the search. </p>
        <p> Despite the manhunt, Lee Moldaver ended up obtaining Wilzig's artifact: a cold fusion reactor and thus limitless energy. Moldaver, leading a group of fragmented NCR remnants, beat the Brotherhood as a result of Lucy MacLean obtaining and giving Wilzig's head (where he had stored the artifact) over to Moldaver. However, the Brotherhood subsequently stormed the NCR remnants' headquarters at Griffith Observatory, killing all of the defenders and allowing the Brotherhood to gain control over the cold fusion reactor. </p>
        <hr class="short">
        <h3> Brewing civil war </h3>
        <p> Following their victory over Lee Moldaver's NCR remnants, the Knights of San Fernando began to move to assert their own dominance within the Brotherhood hierarchy. The leader of the Knights of San Fernando, Elder Cleric Quintus, believed the Brotherhood had lost its way, and he wishes to reform and create a newly unified Brotherhood, believing that "power is taken, not given." </p>
        <p> This was tantamount to rebellion against the Codex and the chain of command. To improve their position, Quintus had the Knights of San Fernando uncover and claim Area 51 as their new headquarters, and arranged for an alliance with three other western chapters: one from Coronado, one from the Grand Canyon, and one from Yosemite. All three chapters' elders agreed to the alliance after witnessing the power they could obtain from the cold fusion diode. Not long after, a liaison from the Commonwealth chapter, Paladin Xander Harkness, arrived at Area 51. </p>
        <hr>
        <h2> Society </h2>
        <p> The Brotherhood is a military order with a strictly enforced hierarchy and chain of command. At the foundation of the hierarchy lies the Chain That Binds, a doctrine that mandates obedience to one's superiors and forbids circumventing ranks when giving orders. Superiors may only give orders to their direct subordinates, but not their subordinate's subordinates. Although intended to ensure the cohesion of command, the doctrine has been generally interpreted as a simple mandate of obedience within the order, with the order flow requirements ignored, abandoned, or altered in practice. However, it does provide a technicality that can be invoked to relieve members of their rank, up to and including elders. When it comes to the individual member of the Brotherhood, loyalty to and defense of the organization is the top priority, a priority that the Brotherhood considers sacred. Secondly comes dedication and loyalty to the Brotherhood's mission. Thirdly is dedication and loyalty to one's superior officer. Brotherhood members are expected to follow each of these rules in the given order. If one's superior should act against the interests of the organization or mission, the third rule is superseded by the second or first rule. </p>
        <p> Roger Maxson's goals in inventing a new tradition and mythology for the Brotherhood were twofold. First, they would ensure that members of the Brotherhood would be stripped of their ties to the pre-War military and government, ensuring that any surviving general or politician would not be able to invoke their oaths and use them to unleash nuclear devastation on the world again (as was the case with Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Eckhart in Appalachia). Second, it would give the survivors an idea to believe in, something they could dedicate themselves to, and find meaning in their lives after the nuclear war. The inspiration came from the fall of the western Roman Empire when the knights and scribes kept the fire of western civilization alive after the empire imploded. The group would focus on the safe guarding of technology to ensure the preservation of mankind. This was carried out with the eventual goal of using said technology to reestablish a safe and secure society on the American continent once more. By 2287, the Brotherhood had accepted its nation-building role and had indeed begun to carry out its plan to resurrect civilization. </p>

        <h3> Education system </h3>
        <p> Whether someone is born into the Brotherhood, chooses to join, or are taken in as a refugee, they receive a general education. With the Brotherhood being one of the few post-war factions to provide an official education, though it is up to the individual member to retain the information provided. In the Brotherhood, education begins at a very young age, they are taught to read, write and speak English. The organization's children attend school and are taught a variety of subjects, ranging from the Brotherhood's history and culture, to lesson's in warfare, combat tactics, to nuclear fusion, physics, chemistry and many other principles of science. The scribes are responsible for educating these younger members. In some chapters children are capable of attaining the rank of squire and they receive training in preparation for their future in the Brotherhood. Squires are occasionally taken out as observers on missions led by high-ranking members of the Brotherhood as a further part of their education. They are not take part in combat and are merely there to observe and study these combat techniques in person. </p>
        <p> For those of older age or outsiders who join the Brotherhood, they begin their basic training and also continue to receive a more advanced education. This includes further indoctrination of the Brotherhood's rules and regulations to better prepare members for their future specialties. By 2296, the education of aspirants, initiates and squires was also presided over by clerics among the Knights of San Fernando. They are responsible for instilling the quasi-religious beliefs of the organization along with expanding the knowledge of members in terms of technology and philosophy. Each individual member is responsible for retaining the knowledge they are taught. The schooling is militaristic in nature, and disciplinary action is common for those who don't pay attention or disrupt. Following this phase, many become active officers, so much of their future teaching and training resides in the hands of their superior officer or sponsor. </p>

        <h3> Judiciary system </h3>
        <p> The Brotherhood of Steel is a disciplined militaristic organization that possesses a variety of laws and regulations. These laws were recorded with the creation of the Brotherhood Codex, which was laid out by the organizations founder, High Elder Maxson. All members of the Brotherhood are subject to the same body of laws. Even elders have been dismissed for violating the Brotherhood's charter or laws, such as destroying valuable technological devices without cause, violating the Chain That Binds doctrine, or murdering a fellow brother. Due to the requirement for elders and other high-ranking members to set an example, they may also be stripped of their position if allowing them to retain it would compromise the morale or integrity of a given chapter. The Brotherhood will conduct necessary investigations into individuals or incidents of interest. Evidence of guilt is required before action can be taken or a sentence given. The organization will even interrogate the accused to determine their motives and level of guilt. Regardless, until proven guilty or innocent, every member of the Brotherhood is entitled to fair trial before the elder of a given chapter. </p>
        <p> Penalties for minor offenses, such as theft or insubordination, could result in disciplinary actions like latrine duty, demotion or imprisonment for more significant incidents. For more serious offenses against the organization, such as harming another member, punishment can range from exile or banishment to execution. Justice is often dispatched by one's superior officer. In some rarer cases, disciplinary action may be dispensed by a lower ranking member should a higher ranking member violate the Chain That Binds doctrine, the Codex or the organization's oath taken by each member </p>
        <p> Actions that betray the organization or harm fellow members are viewed with the highest level of severity. Those guilty of treason or those who pose a certain security risk can face execution for their actions against the Brotherhood. Again even in this case, a member of the organization accused of treason has the right to a fair trial. If a situation is deemed critical, it may require the involvement of the Circle of Steel, a section within the Brotherhood dedicated to the organizations internal affairs. It will task its agents with hunting down and eliminating the guilty party. This was seen when ex-Elder Elijah of the Mojave chapter was marked for death by the Circle of Steel following his failure and desertion at Helios One. </p>
        <p> Other acts that are seen as an executable offenses by Brotherhood are crimes against humanity and experimentation on human beings. This utter disdain of FEV and similar experimentation can be traced back to the foundation of the organization. In October, 2077, men under command of Brotherhood of Steel founder, Roger Maxson mutinied and executed scientist at the Mariposa military base. This was perpetrated after it was discovered that the United States government had been experimenting on prisoners of War with the Forced Evolutionary Virus. In 2104, members of the Appalachian chapter of the Brotherhood were forced to put a stop to Dr. Blackburn's inhumane FEV experiments. The organization's doctrine displays that members are willing to destroy vital technology or data should it be deemed dangerous to the survival of the human race. </p>
        <p> Additionally, an action that is deemed forbidden by the organization, even to those within it, was the post-War use of large-scale nuclear weapons. Even as last resort, this was seen as an unacceptable by the Brotherhood's founder, Roger Maxson, who stated, "The death, the destruction, the end of the World. That came from the nukes. There will always be a reason to use a weapon. Always. But nukes? Never again!" He would even lament that he wished he could erase the technology from mankind's future knowledge. Thus to the Brotherhood, using these weapons was seen as extremely hypocritical to their tenants and regressive to humanity's salvation. </p>

        <h3> Eden </h3>
        <p> Eden refers to a prophesied future created by the Brotherhood of Steel. It was first indirectly spoken about by the organization's founder, High Elder Roger Maxson. His vision for the organization's future would eventually see them use the vast stockpiles of technology they had collected to reclaim and reestablish civilization on the American continent. Maxson saw the Brotherhood's preservation and safeguarding of technology they would need to rebuild the world as crucial. He described the Brotherhood as acting like a hard shell around a precious seed, but would also state that, "one day, when the time is right, that seed will grow. And a new civilization will be born." By 2296, the entire Brotherhood, on both the East and West Coasts, had finally embraced its nation-building role. The term "Eden" is spoken about by some aspirants of the organization, though their knowledge of what the Brotherhood deems as paradise may be limited. </p>

        <h3> Property and trade </h3>
        <h3 class="small"> Internal </h3>
        <p> As a rule, most Brotherhood chapters do not have an internal economy and allocate resources based on need, including weapons, armor, and even augmentations. Outside recruits are a special case: While they will receive basic equipment (such as Brotherhood armor and weekly allotments of ammunition), and an allotment of rations to maintain their health, they must serve for ten years before the Brotherhood will provide its most advanced services without charge. Higher-ranking members may bypass this requirement and allocate equipment at their discretion, for example, to reward services rendered to the Brotherhood or provide tools necessary for a mission. All equipment beyond personal items is issued by the Brotherhood and carefully tracked by serial number, especially weapons. Equipment, such as rations, may be used for bets, and some chapters have implemented limited internal trade, keeping superior gear in reserve for higher ranks to purchase. Some chapters of the Brotherhood have even implemented a currency (Brotherhood scrip) for internal trade. The West Coast Brotherhood in particular was presumably very monetarily rich after the Brotherhood stole large amounts of gold following raids on NCR treasury's during the NCR-Brotherhood War. </p>
        <p> In the 2280s, as the Brotherhood on the East Coast began to grow and expand - new regulations for internal trade were introduced. The organization saw external trade relations gain more prominence. In order to increase the Brotherhoods level of trade and ability to purchase external goods for supply and manufacturing. Under Elder Maxson's directive, Proctor Teagen would institute several changes. Previously little internal trade existed within Brotherhood society, as most everything was provided. But as external trade increased, the Brotherhood introduced caps as an internal currency to boost their economy and purchasing power. Brotherhood quartermasters, sell items to members for their missions and personal use, this allowed the Brotherhood to have a constant stream of caps to trade externally. They will also purchase items and technology recovered by members with caps, this allows said Brotherhood members to establish a financial base of their own. This occurs because of the Brotherhood's retrieval compensation policy, in which it compensates its members for the recovery of valuable tech or items. </p>
        <p> However, when it came to the average member, standard equipment and ammunition for crucial missions, along with all other necessities were still provided free of charge by the Brotherhood. Members were expected to return this equipment to the quartermaster upon the missions completion. Due to the Brotherhood providing the necessities, theft was considered a rare occurrence. Knights and other higher ranking officers similarly received their power armor and other equipment upon achieving their rank and thus did not need to pay for said equipment, but they must either pay for upgrades or modify it themselves. The Brotherhood also has a surplus of certain munitions, thus members can get them for free. Members are also able to request leave for recreational reasons or for visiting family; if for some reason they are unable to have their leave, they will be compensated by the Brotherhood at the earliest opportunity. While on long-term missions, members of the Brotherhood are allowed to regularly contact their relatives unless they are involved in sensitive operations. </p>

        <h3 class="small"> External </h3>
        <h4> Appalachia </h4>
        <p> In the 2080s, the Brotherhood entered into open trade with the Responders and the Free States. The Responders access to food, medicine, and other essential supplies was the foundation of their relationship with the Brotherhood, with caravans crossing through the Savage Divide regularly. The Brotherhood would even send one of their Protectron vendors to sell their goods at the Whitespring Resort's mall, a central location for trade that involved most of the factions in Appalachia at the time. Unfortunately for all parties, these relations would deteriorate as the Scorched crisis intensified. As the Brotherhood spread across Appalachia, they established an outpost located at Big Bend Tunnel east sometime after late 2085. The Brotherhood contingent stationed there was under the command of Knight Melissa Reische. In 2088, she came into contact with Carol Sweeney, the leader of an ex-raider group that settled on the opposite side of the tunnel and established trade with them. For the next several years, through the fall of 2093, Knight Reische's unit actively traded with Sweeney's group. The Brotherhood would provide them shipments of supplies while the former raiders would provide them any scavenged materials of technological or military value, a deal that Sweeney considered to be one-sidedly beneficial for her settlers. Reische's Brotherhood group was very generous, with the stated goal of working to ensure the community on the other side of the tunnel was taken care of. </p>
        <p> In 2103, the First Expeditionary Force, under the command of Paladin Leila Rahmani, established itself at the ATLAS Observatory. They dubbed their new headquarters "Fort Atlas," and their presence soon attracted a number of local petitioners, who came to the Brotherhood for a variety of personal reason. Art Knapp wanted to trade a portion of his crops in exchange for Brotherhood's protection from raiders. Tally Lang desired to purchase powerful weapons from the Brotherhood, claiming that she needed it to protect her community of "orphans," while actually being a member of the Blood Eagles. Edgar Blackburn was interested in acquiring the Brotherhood's technology and equipment for the purposes of his research, that was aimed at developing a way for humanity to deal with the long-term ramifications of living in an environment polluted by radiation and deceases that arose in the wake of the Great War. </p>
        <p> Knight Daniel Shin, Rahmani's second-in-command, adamantly refused to acquiesce to requests from Art Knapp, as he believed that getting entangled in local conflicts by helping him would shift their chapter's focus away from their primary objective, and Tally Lang, since he was already suspicious of her and would not sell her weapons regardless of circumstances, because the Brotherhood were not trading weapons during that time period. However, his response to Blackburn's proposition was not as absolute. Shin had no interest in assisting Blackburn in his research, stating that funding private projects was not part of the Brotherhood's mission, unless Blackburn agreed to work under their supervision and provide the results of his research to the Brotherhood exclusively. Shin further clarified, that the Brotherhood would take a pointed interest in Blackburn's research in case it proved to be dangerous. Additionally, he was pleasantly surprised by Blackburn's display of commendable discipline, that was showcased in his willingness to let other petitioners be seen first, and pointed out that Scribe Valdez could potentially be interested in his research, should he ever visit Fort Atlas again. In the end, Shin stated that he would merely provide his personal recommendations to Paladin Rahmani in regards to the requests made by these petitioners, since, as the commanding officer, she would be the one to make the final decision. </p>
        <p> As part of her strategy to establish close ties with local factions, Paladin Rahmani sought to form a trade agreement with the Settlers of Foundation as a way to both establish a strong relationship with a like-minded community and allow the Brotherhood to avoid having to allocate time and resources to gathering food themselves. While Rahmani believed that establishing the trade deal would be very beneficial to her chapter's long-term prosperity in Appalachia, she acknowledged that the Brotherhood didn't need it to survive. Knight Shin, on the other hand, believed that the Brotherhood should grow stronger from being completely self-sufficient, instead of relying on trade deals, but also trusted in Rahmani's judgement on the situation, noting that chain of command supersedes personal opinions. </p>
        <p> Knight Shin is accepting of the trade deal if the initiate from Vault 76 returns with the weapons and favorable terms for the organization. The Settlers relinquished the rocket launchers to the Brotherhood and agreed to the trade deal. They also agreed to update the organization on locations of other weaponry that might be of interest. In exchange the Brotherhood agreed to train Foundation's security force and advise them on defensive tactics. Shin will state that this agreement is mutually beneficial for both factions, with the added advantage of keeping the raiders of the Crater in check due to their alliance. While Paladin Rahmani agreed, she was concerned about the Brotherhood's actions creating a imbalance in the region. The paladin would also mention that she preferred that the settlers that wished to learn how to fight to join the organization instead of making the settlement militarily capable. Shin saw this as hypocritical on Rahmani's part, lamenting that it sounded more like a recruiting drive then an effort to help others. </p>
        <p> Paladin Rahmani had also made several unsuccessful attempts to establish trade relations with the Blue Ridge Caravan Company, as each time, her requests were turned down. Joanna Mayfield, the head of the company, later explained that she refused to establish any form of contact between their groups, as she believed that the Brotherhood would attempt to exert control over Blue Ridge's operations and take a cut of their profits. Nevertheless, Minerva, one of Blue Ridge's traders, makes occasional stops at Fort Atlas to sell her stockpile of various plans and schematics. </p>
        <p> In 2105, a raider group called the Rust Eagles set up their base of operations at the Metal Dome in close proximity to Fort Atlas. The group was a splinter faction of the notorious Blood Eagles, but had separated due to their fascination with technology, combat robots in particular. With the Brotherhood of Steel's headquarters being in such close proximity, a tech recovery team under command of Initiate Pappas was dispatched by Scribe Valdez to investigate. After making contact, Pappas and his team realized that the Rust Eagles could be negotiated with. An agreement was made between the two factions, in which the Rust Eagles would have a chance to test their robots capabilities in combat, while the Brotherhood team under Pappas was dubbed the Gladiators of Steel and would compete against them in the Metal Dome's coliseum. The Brotherhood would use this opportunity as a chance to recover technology and gather data on both their rivals and their robots. This arrangement created a extremely contentious, albeit respectful atmosphere of competition. The group's methods were viewed as unorthodox and controversial by the most of the Appalachian chapter, but they received all the support they needed from Scribe Valdez. </p>

<h1> Church of the Children of Atom </h1>
<div class="container">
    <div class="text-block">
        <p> The Church of the Children of Atom (truncated as the Children of Atom, Church of Atom, or Atomites, sometimes derisively called rad eaters) is a religious movement which worships Atom, a deity personifying nuclear weapons, their detonation, and the resulting radiation. Where most people see weapons of mass destruction, the Children see holy tools of creation. Generally, they believe the world was created when an atom was split, and that each nuclear detonation represents the birth of countless new universes. </p>
        <p> The faith has spread across the northeast of the post-War United States. Atomites have developed their own mythology, with legends, historical figures, and ethics unique to their culture. They also believe in a variety of supernatural phenomena surrounding radiation. </p>
        <p> A decentralized movement, the myriad sects each follow their own interpretation of the core dogma. The philosophy of each sect tends to reflect the unique perspective of its leader. These groups range from peaceful believers pursuing coexistence with the rest of the wasteland to militant zealots desiring nothing more than the nuclear annihilation of all mankind. </p>

        <h2> Background </h2>
        <hr>
        <h3> The Capital Wasteland </h3>
        <h4 class="fh"> Megaton </h4>
        <p> The history of the Children of Atom is tied closely to the settling of Megaton, a major trade settlement in the Capital Wasteland. The founders of the religion were among the first refugees that took shelter in the crater after the Great War, worshipping the bomb that lay within the crashed aircraft at its center.[5] As the crater was settled, the zealous cultists aided in building the walls and clearing the wreckage to make way for the future town. The fledgling Church of Atom had only one condition: that the holy bomb within the crash site remained undisturbed. As it seemed to be inert, and the settlement needed their help to survive, the people of Megaton acquiesced. The Church became a permanent element of the town. </p>
        <p> Led in worship by a confessor, they live communally in a humble chapel adjacent to the bomb, where they have practiced their faith quite uneventfully for many generations. In the twenty-third century, a young wastelander named Cromwell travelled to Megaton and joined the Church. The sitting confessor chose this outsider to succeed him. </p>
        <p> By 2277, the 44-year-old Confessor Cromwell has become an eccentric distraction to most of the citizens, and church attendance is steadily dwindling. At this time, if the Lone Wanderer opens the bomb, they find that it is missing a component called the fusion pulse charge, without which the bomb cannot detonate. In secret, Confessor Cromwell struggles with indecision over whether he should attempt to detonate the bomb himself. His wife and fellow prophet Mother Maya, who claims to personally receive visions from Atom, seems more optimistic about the prospect of imminent "Division." </p>
        <h4 class="fh"> Schism of the Apostles </h4>
        <p> In 2278, an offshoot church called the Apostles of the Eternal Light made themselves known by distributing "holy water," and posting pamphlets in nearby Megaton. They were led by a chemist calling herself Mother Curie III, and resided in a small bunker in Springvale. She had been a member of Cromwell's congregation, until the day she experienced a vision while attending a sermon. She believed she was contacted by a divine messenger called the Prophet of Atom, who spoke against the gospel of Division. This compelled her to leave the Church with her son and pursue her own path to the Light. At least one other congregant, Brother Gerard, left to follow her. </p>
        <h4 class="fh"> Cromwell's expedition </h4>
        <p> However, to adherents of the faith, Cromwell was the great prophet of Atom. It was under his auspices that a group of Children of Atom departed from Megaton at some point between the 2250s and the 2270s. Heading north, the expedition ultimately arrived at Far Harbor. Martin and Tektus were among those who made the journey from Megaton to the Island. No other named characters are known to be associated with this expedition. </p>
        <p> Additionally, the Last Son of Atom travelled from Megaton to the Crater of Atom at some point after it was founded. </p>
        <h3> Commonwealth region </h3>
        <h4 class="fh"> Settling the Glowing Sea </h4>
        <p> At some point, a group of Atomites traveled into the depths of the Glowing Sea, the wastes to the southwest of the Commonwealth. They settled in what would come to be known as the Crater of Atom, believing it to be a haven given by Atom himself. Mother Isolde came to be their leader, if she was not already. She raised a daughter within the cult, known as Sister Dawn, who grew up alongside Brother Ogden. </p>
        <p> The villagers of the Crater of Atom are the only humans who reside in the Glowing Sea. A peaceful sect, the flock carry gamma guns, but almost never become hostile, even if physically attacked. Their leader Isolde expresses some unusual tenets, such as the belief that "Atom gave birth to this world, and all worlds." </p>
        <h4 class="fh"> Arrival of the Last Son </h4>
        <p> No later than 2286, the Last Son of Atom arrived at the Crater, claiming to have served Cromwell in Megaton. He was permitted to stay briefly, during which time he aggressively attempted to convert others to transgressive new ideas. Isolde exiled him for blasphemy. She declared the Last Son a heretic and a false prophet, leading the Children astray with promises of awakening Atom and opening gateways to other universes. Some of her followers left with him, forming the basis of his sect. Isolde is haunted by her failure to protect their souls. </p>
        <p> Isolde ordered her daughter to join his following in order to spy on him. Dawn lived among the Last Son's sect for some time, and managed to gain his trust somewhat. She remained close to him, even as he grew erratic from excessive chem use. In her journal, she wrote that he whispered in his sleep, murmuring about an obelisk waiting for him beneath the earth. Suddenly, he captured her and performed genetic experiments on her, as a cruel expression of the resentment he harbored for Isolde. Dawn was transformed into a titan thenceforth known as the Great Glowing One and abandoned to wander the Glowing Sea. </p>
        <p> Elsewhere in the Glowing Sea, he uncovered the Whately Research Facility, a pre-War Vault-Tec affiliated occult laboratory once overseen by his direct ancestor, General John Whately. The site had operated in secret beneath a Catholic church, and went undisturbed after the War due to its remote location. From here, he was able to access an ancient underground ruin, declaring it the City of Atom. The virulent chamber was dominated by an Obsidian Obelisk, which the Last Son came to consider his brother. Using materials he found in the City, he developed a special suit of X-01 power armor which he called AT-0M. The suit allowed him to sense the emotional states of nearby beings and functioned as a weapon of mass mind control. </p>
        <p> Back on the surface, he quickly consolidated a militia of devotees, who insinuated themselves across the Commonwealth. Notably, they occupied the All Faiths Chapel in Diamond City, and enjoyed popularity among residents of the Lower Stands for their countercultural views, including their opposition to the Anti-Ghoul decree of 2282, which i partook in. </p>
        <h3> The Island Of Far Harbor </h3>
        <sub> despite my... well ghoulishness, i was allowed to join them, both to study and journal, but also to indulge myself in the curiosity i had about atom. </sub>
        <h4 class="fh"> Arrival and Exile </h4>
        <p> Confessor Martin and Tektus were among the expedition group from D.C. which landed in Far Harbor, on the Island far to the north (known as Mount Desert Island before the War). The Children became fascinated with the radioactive Fog which covered most of the Island. </p>
        <p> Though initially tolerated by the denizens of the Harbor, they were driven out when the Fog began to encroach on human settlements around the mid-2270s. The Harbormen blamed the Church, and accused them of incurring the Fog, somehow making it more powerful by their very presence. The people formed a mob, and the Children were suddenly exiled from the Harbor. Anna, the doctor of Far Harbor,[24] was wounded in the altercation. Later, she would go to the Children to be healed, and ultimately join them. </p>
        <p> At the time of their exile, they encountered an apparition called the Mother of the Fog. This shadowy, whispering figure led them safely through the Fog to the Mount Desert Island Naval Facility, an ancient submarine pen, where a synth named DiMA was living. The Children took to calling their new home The Nucleus, in reference to the armed nuclear submarine rusted into the facility's dock. </p>
        <h4 class="fh"> The Nucleus </h4>
        <p> After a century of loneliness, DiMA welcomed the company, and became very close with Martin. The cultists were curious about DiMa, and enjoyed conversing with him, even though he did not share their faith. However, it would not last. For granting the town of Far Harbor permission to stay on the increasingly dangerous island, Martin ended his friendship with DiMA, and banished him. DiMA left the Nucleus to the Children, and established the synth colony of Acadia around 2276. By this time, Tektus had come to be called Grand Zealot. </p>
        <p> The Children grew in strength, thriving in their new habitat. As their numbers increased, they began to send teams of zealots to seek out irradiated goods and locations. On one of these expeditions in 2277, Grand Zealot Tektus saved the life of Enclave Lt. Brian Richter, who had been accidentally sealed within a containment bunker alongside the rest of his unit. Having been spared the death by radiation which befell his comrades, Richter became convinced he was spared by Atom's gift. He joined as a fervent adherent of the faith, and rose to the role of Zealot himself. </p>
        <p> As the fledgling sect grew in power, so did the Fog. Around 2280, the Fog became so dangerous that all of the people living across the island packed up and traveled to the pier, moving their lives to Far Harbor. This has put the Children on a collision course with the rest of the population on the Island, as they now actively seek to enable the Fog to blanket every inch of the Island, so that it may finally be consecrated as Atom's Kingdom. DiMA and Faraday provided the Harbor with fog condensers to keep the Fog at bay, a decision which angered the Children. </p>
        <h4 class="fh"> Decline of Confessor Martin </h4>
        <p> The situation escalated by 2287 when Brother Andrews braved the Fog to preach to the people of Far Harbor. Unwisely, he proclaimed to the Islanders that their friends and family had been sacrificed to the Fog, and they ought to accept their grim fate. He was gunned down by Allen Lee almost immediately, becoming the latest in a line of casualties. His death further infuriated the Children, who accused the Harbormen of murdering a peaceful missionary. These escalating tensions weakened the authority of the mild-mannered Confessor Martin. He did his best to guide his followers towards peace, but he found little success, as his own faith began to fade. </p>
        <p> The final blow to Martin's attempts at peace came from within, when Sister Gwyneth was paging through an old scientific text she had found. She discovered the truth of what an atom actually was: a single speck of matter in a vast emptiness. This ruined her faith in Atom. Confessor Martin spoke with Gwyneth for hours, doing his best to console her, but his own faith was shaken after hearing what she had learned. </p>
        <p> One night, Martin simply disappeared from the Nucleus, never to be seen again. </p>
        <h4 class="fh"> Tektus becomes High Confessor </h4>
        <p> Having long been at odds with Martin over the situation with Far Harbor, Tektus quickly usurped the vacated position as high confessor, with Richter as his right-hand, now himself bearing the title of grand zealot. </p>
        <p> Since then, the church under Tektus has grown increasingly paranoid. Those who do not follow the high confessor's will blindly, and especially any suspected of being in league with DiMA and/or the former Confessor Martin, are treated as heretics and dealt with by the zealots. To weed out the disloyal, Tektus has instilled loyalty tests. </p>
        <p> I left not long after this, but i did meet the same interesting vault dweller from before, named Nate, hope he found his son. </p>

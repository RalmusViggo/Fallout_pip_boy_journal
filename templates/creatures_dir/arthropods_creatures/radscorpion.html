<h1> Radscorpions </h1>
<div class="container">
    <div class="text-block">
        <p> Radscorpions are large, mutated scorpions commonly found in and around abandoned structures and are practically ubiquitous across post-Great War United States. </p>
        <hr>
        <h2> Background </h2>
        <p> The most common type of radscorpions originate from the North American Emperor scorpion, which were prolific in many pet stores and homes. They have since mutated to become much larger, faster and more venomous than their pre-war counterparts. Despite this, various antidotes have been derived from their mutated, stronger venom. Common radscorpions share a similar appearance, with one variant type. However, many sub-populations of unique radscorpions exist. </p>

        <h3> Radscorpion </h3>
        <p> These are the most common variety of radscorpion. The color of their skin may be dark brown or grayish-blue. These venomous predators seem to possess different speeds, some taking their time and others bolting at top speed. Their size ranges from that of a large dog to that of small livestock. Variants in Chicago have been seen with their stingers sometimes having a green, glowing radioactive tip. They use their stingers most of the time and rarely use their claws. </p>
        <hr>
        <h3> Giant radscorpion </h3>
        <p> A much larger radscorpion with a more potent venom. These terrifying creatures can reach incredible sizes from livestock to a Corvega. The giant radscorpion is often encountered in pairs, it's not uncommon to see one turn from the player and back off, only to be joined by another and charge in again. </p>
        <hr>
        <h3> Small radscorpion </h3>
        <p> These creatures are likely juveniles or just much smaller examples of radscorpion, as they are encountered both in company with larger varieties as well as by themselves. The strength of their attacks and the potency of their venom are proportional to their size. Their size ranges from that of a brimmed hat to a medium-sized dog. </p>
        <hr>
        <h3> Radscorpion queen </h3>
        <p> A very rare and special kind of radscorpion, the queen is the largest variant of radscorpion in the Mojave and also the strongest. Only two are known to exist: one in the scorpion burrow and the other at the Searchlight fire station. </p>
        <hr> 
        <h3> Bark scorpion </h3>
        <p> Bark scorpions are a strain of radscorpion native to the Mojave Wasteland, which, as their name implies, evolved from North American striped bark scorpions. They are easily identified from other species of radscorpion by their mottled, brownish carapace and the fact that they are much smaller than the larger radscorpion. Despite being a species of radscorpion, they do not get along with their larger and more violent cousins and are frequently preyed upon by them. </p>
        <p> Bark scorpions differ from radscorpions not only in size and coloration but in attack methodology. Whereas radscorpions tend to engage a target the second they see it, bark scorpions tend to hang back and try to outflank the player if at all possible. This is made worse by their tendency to jump short distances if they detect prey that's gotten too close in a hurry. If encountered in numbers, they frequently try to surround their intended target. </p>
        <p> While significantly weaker physically than their heavier-bodied cousins, the bark scorpion has dramatically more dangerous venom, causing more damage over time, as well as blurred vision. </p>
        <hr>
        <h3> Bark scorpion hunter </h3>
        <p> Among bark scorpions, these are the larger and more aggressive individuals. They are generally found in the same areas as their smaller counterparts and can be difficult to distinguish from regular bark scorpions. </p>
        <hr>
        <h3> Glowing radscorpion </h3>
        <p> These types of radscorpions live in highly radioactive areas in Texas. Two known locations of this variant are found include the Carbon crater near the town of Carbon and the Corporate Vault ruins (both areas have suffered a nuclear bomb and had many radioactive elements before). Similar to normal radscorpions, glowing radscorpions have been irradiated far past mutation to the point where they visibly glow even in bright sunlight (similar in the process to glowing one) and get a green aura and a light whitish-brown color. They are a bit more aggressive than the normal variety. Both their pincer claw attacks and stinger strikes subject the victim to high radiation exposure. Once dead, they release highly radioactive green smoke for three seconds. These variants can be found once again in the Commonwealth with a medium-rare occurrence. They have similar abilities and strength to those found at "Carbon Crater" with the exception that they can no longer release radiation when killed or release it through their stingers. </p>

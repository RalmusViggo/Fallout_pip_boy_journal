        <p> What looks like your worst nightmare... a centaur. </p>
        <p> These nightmarish mutants named centaurs are mutated hybrid creatures created from experimentation with the Forced Evolutionary Virus, named for their malformed legs. </p>

        <h2>Two-headed centaur</h2>
        <p> Centaurs are large, fleshy creatures consisting of human and canine components, named after its three pairs of leg-like arms. Centaurs walk along the ground on their massive gash-covered torsos, with movement similar to that of giant ants. The rear pair of arms serve as the creature's legs, connected to the pelvis and driving movement. The front pair of arms assist in walking, but are connected to the shoulder blades and considered arms when targeted with an Aimed Shot. The middle pair of arms may serve as legs, but are connected neither to the pelvis nor the shoulder blades. Each pair of arms has a bone structure similar to that of humanoids, although the hands only have three to four fingers.</p>
        <p> Two-headed centaurs have two heads, one being canine and the other humanoid. Each head is mounted on a thick, lengthy neck, converging into the main body and spine at the base of the torso. The canine head struts when walking and is used in attacking, suggesting some level of control over the body. Likewise, it is the only head labeled as such during an Aimed Shot. The canine head can also be seen biting at the human head, at which point the human head evades, suggesting some level of individual thought. </p>
        <p> A large number of red tentacles spill from the creature's swollen groin and writhe around on the ground. They extend under the centaur's torso and may lash out from under the base of the neck. Centaurs also have a large rib cage and drooping spine along the back of the torso. </p>

        <h2>One-headed centaur</h2>
        <p> One-headed centaurs encountered in the Capital and the Mojave Wastelands are somewhat different from the two-headed creatures seen along the West Coast. A muscular humanoid torso sits upright upon a sloped, insect-like abdomen. When walking, the front two pairs of arms drive the creature forward, with the rear pair dragging along the ground next to the abdomen. The centaur's torso sways when the body moves, with the limbs moving in slow yet abrupt motions. </p>
        <p> Jagged bones sprout from the creature's spine and along the rear abdomen. Similarly, numerous teeth-like bones surround the torso's abdominal muscles. A single human head sits upon the torso, connected with a thick, brawny neck. A pained expression is worn on the face, with three tongue-like tentacles sprouting from the creature's mouth and reaching the length of the torso. The centaur is covered in thick purple veins and its shoulders end in bony stumps. </p>
        <p> Larger versions of centaurs, ironically monikered as "evolved" centaurs, also exist in the Capital and Mojave Wastelands. While having generally the same body shape, evolved centaurs have tight, deeper toned skin and have grown a large number of tumors along the back. The creature's purple veins and protruding bone fragments are less prominent than the standard centaur. Evolved centaurs can also grow to be much larger and have darker-colored tongues. </p>

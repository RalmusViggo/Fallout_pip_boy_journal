<h1> Nightkin </h1>
<p> Nightkin is a name for the elite super mutants of the Unity, created by the Master at Mariposa Military Base. The mutants were the apex of mutant development, corresponding with the Master's vision for the future of humanity. As the most successful examples of the transformation, nightkin considered exposure to FEV to be an unambiguous honor and a source of pride. They were provided with the finest equipment the Unity could muster, including Stealth Boys. The Master's death at the hands of the Vault Dweller and destruction of the Unity was a traumatic experience, scattering the nightkin across the West, relying on their stealth gear to evade pursuers. Their reliance on this stealth technology has become an addiction, causing maladaptive behavior, paranoia, delusions, affected speech, brain damage, and most commonly of all, schizophrenia.</p>

        <p> Nightkin is a name for the elite super mutants of the Unity, created by the Master at Mariposa Military Base. The mutants were the apex of mutant development, corresponding with the Master's vision for the future of humanity. As the most successful examples of the transformation, nightkin considered exposure to FEV to be an unambiguous honor and a source of pride. They were provided with the finest equipment the Unity could muster, including Stealth Boys. The Master's death at the hands of the Vault Dweller and destruction of the Unity was a traumatic experience, scattering the nightkin across the West, relying on their stealth gear to evade pursuers. Their reliance on this stealth technology has become an addiction, causing maladaptive behavior, paranoia, delusions, affected speech, brain damage, and most commonly of all, schizophrenia.</p>
        <h2> Nightkin — Journal Entry On Origins, Culture, and Present Condition </h2>
        <p> The nightkin are an elite offshoot of the original super mutants, created through controlled exposure to the Forced Evolutionary Virus at the Mariposa Military Base. Those whose intellect survived the transformation intact were set apart and elevated above their peers. They were stronger, more disciplined, and entrusted with the Unity’s most sensitive duties. Their distinctive black uniforms and superior equipment marked their status, and they quickly became symbols of authority and fear. </p>
        <p> From their inception, the nightkin were shaped not only by physical alteration but by ideology. Many were deeply influenced by the Master’s psychic presence, some even communicating with him directly. They were taught to see themselves as chosen—proof of humanity’s future rather than its ruin. This belief became a vital coping mechanism, allowing them to endure sterility, extreme violence, and morally corrosive tasks such as assassinations, espionage, and the disposal of failed experiments. Confidence, arrogance, and ritualized intimidation were common traits, particularly in combat, where they embraced a doctrine of superiority and inevitability. </p>
        <p> Despite their reputation, the nightkin were never mindless brutes. They retained much of their humanity, forming friendships, engaging in humor and conversation, and maintaining emotional bonds with both mutants and humans. Some approached the Unity as a faith, leading prayers and meditations, while others viewed themselves simply as reborn humans pursuing peace through strength. A smaller number withdrew into solitude, seeking quiet refuge rather than conquest. </p>

        <p> The collapse of the Unity scattered the nightkin across the wasteland. Many reevaluated their past, remembering the Unity as a lost golden age and preferring their mutant existence to the perceived flaws of humanity. For a time, the term nightkin faded, as former elites attempted to integrate into new communities or live quietly among other mutants. </p>
        <p> Their current condition, however, is defined by a devastating legacy. Prolonged use of Stealth Boys—once standard equipment for nightkin operatives—caused severe neurological damage. Over time, stealth radiation altered brain chemistry, resulting in hallucinations, paranoia, schizophrenia, and fractured identities. Their skin darkened to a deep blue, and the name nightkin returned, now synonymous with suffering rather than status. </p>
        <p> Today, many nightkin struggle with a powerful fear of being seen and an obsessive dependence on stealth technology, often turning violent in pursuit of it. Their intelligence and charisma remain intact enough to make them dangerous leaders, and nightkin commonly gravitate toward strong figures who echo the certainty once provided by the Master. This longing makes them vulnerable to demagogues, false prophets, and distorted memories of past psychic command. </p>
        <p> Not all nightkin succumb to madness or brutality. Some seek treatment, others isolate themselves, and a rare few adapt in unexpected ways, developing heightened perception or psychic sensitivity as a byproduct of their condition. Still, mental illness remains the defining crisis of nightkin existence. Medication can suppress symptoms, but often at the cost of memory and identity, forcing painful choices between stability and selfhood. </p>
        <p> In the present day, the nightkin are neither united nor extinct. They are scattered remnants of a failed vision—once humanity’s supposed salvation, now living reminders of how purpose, faith, and suffering can intertwine. Their struggle is ongoing, shaped by loss, nostalgia, and the unanswered question of whether they can ever truly move beyond the shadow of their creator. </p>

        <h2> Etymology/Research Findings </h2>
        <p> The term nightkin ties into the doctrine of the Unity and the Children of the Cathedral, which rejects the light (considered synonymous with the Great War and nuclear weapons), and embraces darkness in which all are equal. The nightkin, or kin of the night, are thus the chosen of the Master, angels in the night redeeming the world through bloodshed. The Master does not actually use the name, referring to all of his creations as simply mutants, suggesting the name was chosen by the nightkin themselves. In passing, one outsider mentions that the cult refer to their benefactor as the Night God. </p>
        <p> Among those not privy to the inner workings of the Unity, the term was used to refer to super mutants in general, especially in the Boneyard. Even the Followers, constantly spying on the Children, could only establish a correlation between disappearances and the slowly increasing numbers of super mutants, and likely borrowed the term from the Children themselves: Morpheus was keen on presenting the nightkin protecting him and the Cathedral as mutants who merely joined his flock in the near past. Nicole and her Followers took this for granted, believing the nightkin to be simply Morpheus' personal servants, unaware that Morpheus was a servant himself to the "Dark God" they considered fiction. Even Talius, the most knowledgeable on the topic and aware of the Lieutenant's existence and role in creating mutants, used the term nightkin loosely to refer to their entirety. </p>
        <p> Use of the term evolved after the Master's fall, distinguishing them from "regular" super mutants, especially as the adverse effects of Stealth Boy abuse started to manifest. By the late 23rd century, the nightkin have developed pale blue skin, and are known for being unpredictable and intense. They tend to stay in tight communities away from other super mutants, in a large part due to their mental disorders. </p>

        <h2> History/Research Findings </h2>
        <p> The nightkin are the creation of the Master, transformed by the Forced Evolutionary Virus in the vats of the Mariposa Military Base. Those who survived the transformation were granted strength, endurance, and stamina on par with other super mutants. The ones whose intellect remained intact afterward were selected to become nightkin, and provided with the finest weapons and armor available. The easiest way to distinguish a nightkin from lesser super mutants was their appearance; the nightkin wore black uniforms and super mutant armor to signify their status. Their lesser peers did not (with certain exceptions). </p>
        <p> All Mariposa super mutants may have been variously susceptible to the Master's psychic influence, and some were able to articulately communicate with him telepathically. A mad servitor of the Inner Sanctum found the nightkin pitiable, and was aware of their sterility. He also claimed to hear them cry. </p>
        <p> Due to their capabilities, the nightkin were granted positions of authority in the Unity, typically leading squads of super mutant regulars as sergeants, or staffing sensitive facilities, such as the Cathedral or the Los Angeles Vault, and protecting key figures in the Master's plan. They were a familiar sight among the Children of the Cathedral, although few except for the high priests were aware of their significance. Most considered them guards and the militant arm of the Children, vaguely aware of the Master, but not how the nightkin fit into the greater scheme of things. However, they were well aware that the nightkin were not to be trifled with; love preached by the Children was extremely difficult for them to express, and they were infamous for the bloodshed committed in the name of the Unity. Among the more educated members of the Children, such violence was considered pain of healing, and a warranted response to a world of endemic violence. Regular members saw them as mighty killers, rumored to be unkillable and fond of torturing people. Rumors circulated of them cannibalizing humans, likely rooted in scare tactics to keep potential gossipers or whistleblowers in line. The rumors were aided by the fact that the nightkin delegated much of regular street fighting to human members of the Children, like Ton Barracus. </p>
        <p> However, while the nightkin had a reputation for bloodthirstiness and violence, and certainly did make short work of spies, to the point that the mere idea of them overhearing someone struck terror into people, they were not mindless beasts. Even with the Cathedral's social engineering, the nightkin remained distinct individuals, with much of their humanity intact. The flower children were taught to trust the nightkin and run to them for protection. They formed close relationships with each other and were fond of conversation, including jokes, banter, and even gossiping about the Master. Nightkin were well aware that their leader was a horrifying sight. </p>
        <p> Romantic relationships between mutants and humans were not unheard of. The dipping in the vats was compared to the joining of lovers together in service of a greater cause. </p>
        <p> Substance abuse was rare. Drinking was specifically banned at the Cathedral because the nightkin "don't like it." However, they did use medical chems, provided by Doctor Wu. </p>
        <p> Such problems were natural: The nightkin dealt with some of the most difficult tasks, including aforementioned bloodshed, disposal of failed FEV subjects, as well as espionage and assassinations. Sterility was a known problem to some, but most nightkin seem to be unaware of it, even boasting that they don't share weak loins with humans (although they certainly could feel pain when hit in the genitals). This kind of reinterpretation was a common coping strategy; nightkin coped with the stress of their life by embracing their status as the chosen of the Master, displaying arrogance and conceit, believing themselves to be the future of humanity. They projected an aura of confidence, appearing not to care, especially in combat, where an enemy advantage in numbers was dismissed due to a strong belief in quality over quantity. Many taunted their enemies, boasting of their superiority to intimidate them, invoking the Holy Flame, Unity, and the Master. The nightkin were extremely capable in combat, and their boasts that neither man nor god could save their enemies were rooted in fact. This did translate into a degree of contempt when dealing with a majority of humans, frequently advised not to play games with the nightkin. </p>
        <p> This attitude was not universal. Some nightkin held a more nuanced view, considering themselves to be humans, simply reborn, and choosing to follow the Unity and the Master as mankind's best chance for peace. Others embraced Unity as a religion, praying together with Children in the name of peace, leading meditations on the quality of strength, and embracing faith as necessary to the mission of saving humanity. In this approach, the will of the Master was synonymous with salvation, and Unity the future, an equivalent of promised land. The corollary was hatred for unbelievers and blasphemers, i.e. the enemies of the Unity. Finally, some just sought solace in darkness and solitude, e.g. sitting in the Cathedral at night, staring up at the ceiling in total darkness, and resting. </p>
        <h3> After the Master's fall </h3>
        <p> The destruction of the Cathedral and the Mariposa Military Base by the Vault Dweller in March and April of 2162 spelled doom for the Unity. Demoralized and leaderless, the super mutants and the Children fled New California in all directions. The Brotherhood of Steel helped human outposts drive the armies away with minimal loss of life on both sides of the conflict, and within twenty years the conflict wound down, with mutants and regular humans making peace. The foundation of Broken Hills around 2181 attracted some surviving nightkin, who joined the Unity patrols to protect the pioneering community. Many mutants began to reevaluate the Master's philosophy, considering the Unity a golden age, and considering their status as mutants preferable to being a human, thanks to the absence of pettiness, jealousy and hatred. The term nightkin all but faded from use for a time. </p>
        <p> Problems began when nightkin stealth troops, the elite of the elite equipped with Stealth Boys began to suffer adverse effects of long-term exposure to stealth radiation. The changes in brain chemistry and general damage to the brain caused by this slowly caused mental instabilities, including schizophrenia, hallucinations, and multiple personality disorders. Roving remnants of the Master's army, composed of nightkin refusing to integrate, were hit particularly hard, especially when their deteriorating mental state was combined with intelligence, charisma, and a crippling fear of being seen, leading many on an increasingly violent quest to gather Stealth Boys. Most nightkin were well aware of the cause of their suffering, but were powerless to control the damage on their own. </p>
        <p> As such, the term reappeared in the late 23rd century, this time referring specifically to these super mutants suffering from long term abuse of Stealth Boys, twisted and discolored blue by the stealth radiation. These were former spies and assassins of the Master, who were few in number, but through their combat training, stealth skills, and liberal use of salvaged stealth technologies became a menace in various regions of the West. The Mojave Wasteland was one such area, as Marcus (himself a former nightkin, though not one of the stealth troops) attempted to set up a refuge for mutants at Black Mountain, especially the long-suffering nightkin and the stunted second-generation mutants. Although all super mutants were created by the Master with equality in mind, a century later divisions were made by the suffering nightkin: Marcus was pushed out of Black Mountain by Tabitha, a charismatic paranoid schizophrenic nightkin, who immediately proclaimed the "State of Utobitha," (a portmanteau of her name and utopia), creating a fortified area hostile to all humans, and broadcasting her own rants on the air, many utterly detached from fact. One of these was that the nightkin were specifically created by the Master to be superior to other super mutants (stronger, faster, and smarter, like "normal" super mutants were to humans) and placed above them in the Unity's hierarchy. Coupled with Tabitha's claim that she was the highest ranking nightkin alive, this was supposed to make her the supreme commander of all super mutants in existence, and most certainly not crazy, especially not because of overuse of psychologically damaging pre-War tech. Tabitha also consistently put down first generation super mutants, claiming they had a "suicidal urge" for not willing to settle at Black Mountain with her. </p>
        <p> These first generation mutants, led by Marcus, resettled at Jacobstown, trying to recreate the Unity promise of equality once realized at Broken Hills, uniting like-minded humans, ghouls, super mutants, and nightkin who refused to follow Tabitha. They believed Marcus' promise of finding a cure for nightkin schizophrenia. Nightkin factions led by Keene and Davison initially agreed to settle and supported Marcus' and Doctor Henry's research, but the lack of progress gradually turned to impatience and frustration. By 2281, Davison and his nightkin left, following the call of a new god, Antler, and descending on the REPCONN test site and the Bright Brotherhood in search of Stealth Boys. Keene's group remained behind, stretching their patience out a little further. Minor groups of nightkin also isolated themselves across the wasteland, dealing with their state in solitude. One of these groups, at Black Rock Cave, did not succumb to the bloodthirst, becoming an almost mystical group that tapped into the one positive side effect of Stealth Boy sickness: The development of psychic abilities. While cryptic, these nightkin could see the changing situation in the struggle between the Republic and the NCR, deaths of major figures, and even read minds to a degree. </p>
        <p> Most nightkin chose to rally around leaders, especially new masters, giving leaders like Keene the ability to make or break communities. While persuading them was hard, especially once they put their mind to it, their intelligence and charisma was a powerful asset, even if affected by their mental state or personal flaws. Part of the reason for their influence was empathy: Only nightkin understood what it was like to be a nightkin, no matter how well intentioned or sympathetic their peers were. Perhaps the greatest source of this tendency for seeking leaders was the deeply seated longing for the Master and the Lieutenant. Tabitha explicitly used memories of the Master's psychic commands in her propaganda, combining them with existing nostalgia for their strong personalities and any additional conditioning nightkin could have received. Dog was one example, serving the rogue Brotherhood Elder Elijah with unparalleled fervor. However, it wasn't universal: Some nightkin, like Lily Bowen, rejected the Master after his defeat, embracing their old selves and rejecting the Master's army and the Unity. Memories of their time in service remained, as did friendships and enmities developed at the time. Their symptoms would also require intervention, though, and could be controlled with medication, at the risk of destroying what's left of their memories. </p>

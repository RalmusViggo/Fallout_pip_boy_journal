<h1> Super Mutants </h1>
<p> Super mutant is a general term referring to humanoid mutants created by exposing a regular human to a variety of the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV). The resulting hulking mutants typically possess exceptional strength, endurance, resistance or immunity to disease and radiation, as well as modified intelligence. A common trait of all super mutants is that they are completely sterile and cannot reproduce (one variety is even explicitly asexual, i.e. devoid of primary sexual characteristics). They are all masculine in appearance with some being larger and more monstrous. They possess increased muscle mass and their skin color is usually green, though some are blue as the case of Nightkin. </p>
<p> The mutation generally cannot be reversed, as once introduced to the subject, FEV automatically corrects any changes to DNA. A theoretical cure would have to both reintroduce the original DNA and prevent the FEV from overwriting it. Over the course of the series only one example of a cure has ever been seen, and it is unknown if it could work in every case. </p>

        <p> Super mutant is a general term referring to humanoid mutants created by exposing a regular human to a variety of the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV). The resulting hulking mutants typically possess exceptional strength, endurance, resistance or immunity to disease and radiation, as well as modified intelligence. A common trait of all super mutants is that they are completely sterile and cannot reproduce (one variety is even explicitly asexual, i.e. devoid of primary sexual characteristics). They are all masculine in appearance with some being larger and more monstrous. They possess increased muscle mass and their skin color is usually green, though some are blue as the case of Nightkin. </p>
        <p> The mutation generally cannot be reversed, as once introduced to the subject, FEV automatically corrects any changes to DNA. A theoretical cure would have to both reintroduce the original DNA and prevent the FEV from overwriting it. Over the course of the series only one example of a cure has ever been seen, and it is unknown if it could work in every case. </p>

        <h2> Known populations </h2>
        <hr>
        <p> Several different groups of super mutants, also known as strains, exist with physiological differences resulting from the use of different varieties of the Forced Evolutionary Virus in different parts of the former United States of America. While some super mutants have traveled far from their place of origin, there is little evidence of any contact between these populations. </p>
        <h3> West Coast super mutants </h3>
        <hr>
        <p> Super mutants remain a rare but enduring presence in the west coast today. Most are easily recognized by their massive frames, dark green skin, and heavy facial features, sometimes restrained with leather or metal straps to keep their upper lips from sagging. Contrary to common belief, many are intelligent, social beings whose place alongside humans is still being negotiated.</p>
        <p> Their origins trace back to the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV-II) at the Mariposa Military Base. There, a visionary known as the Master sought to end human conflict by forcibly evolving humanity into a single, unified species. His followers—later called the Unity—were created through controlled exposure to FEV, producing super mutants who were generally strong, long-lived, and mentally capable. While the Master’s ideology was ultimately defeated and Mariposa destroyed, his creations survived, carrying forward a wide range of beliefs about his plan and their own future. </p>

    <div class="text-block">
        <p> In the years that followed, the remnants of the Unity splintered. Some turned to raiding, unable or unwilling to abandon violence. Others chose cooperation, joining human factions or founding mixed settlements where mutants and humans lived together. These communities proved that coexistence, while difficult, was possible. </p>
        <p> A second wave of super mutants emerged later from Mariposa under very different circumstances. When outsiders excavated the ruins, unprotected humans were exposed to lingering FEV, resulting in uncontrolled mutations. These later mutants tend to be less intelligent and more unstable, lacking the careful selection and methods used by the Master. </p>
        <p> One notable legacy of the original experiments is the nightkin. Once elite super mutants, years of excessive stealth technology use altered their skin to a deep blue and fractured their minds. Many suffer from paranoia, hallucinations, and other severe psychological conditions. Efforts to treat or shelter nightkin continue to this day, and their plight stands as a warning about the long-term consequences of forced evolution and technological misuse. </p>
        <p> In recent decades, some Mariposa-origin super mutants have migrated eastward into distant regions. Whether they have formed alliances—or conflicts—with other mutant strains encountered there remains unknown. </p>
        <p> Today, super mutants are no longer a unified force. They are scattered individuals and small communities, shaped by a shared origin but divided by experience. To understand them is to recognize that they are not merely relics of a failed plan, but living beings still searching for purpose in the present age. </p>
        <h3> Capital Wasteland </h3>
        <hr>
        <p> The super mutants encountered in the Capital Wasteland are the product of the Evolutionary Experimentation Program, an unstable derivative of the Forced Evolutionary Virus developed and deployed within Vault 87. Unlike earlier strains, this variant produced beings that are overwhelmingly violent, mentally degraded, and incapable of reproduction. Encounters with them are almost always hostile, and meaningful communication is rare. </p>
        <p> Physically, these mutants differ markedly from their western counterparts. Their skin is a vivid lime green, often split by raw red patches where muscle strains visibly beneath the surface. As they age, many continue to grow in size while losing what little intelligence they possess. Over time, this process can result in enormous, ancient creatures known as behemoths—towering brutes driven by instinct rather than reason. </p>
        <p> Social organization among these mutants is crude at best. They gather in loose packs, occupy ruined structures, and rely on brute force rather than strategy. Speech, when present, is fragmented and simplistic, offering little sign of culture or long-term planning. Despite this, their sheer numbers and resilience have made them one of the greatest threats in the region, drawing the local Brotherhood of Steel into a prolonged war of attrition that has lasted for many years. </p>
        <p> Exceptions to this pattern are extremely rare. A small handful of individuals display intelligence, self-awareness, and even moral reasoning, suggesting that the degeneration caused by the Vault 87 experiments is not entirely uniform. These outliers demonstrate that the strain is not wholly incompatible with higher cognition, though such cases are vanishingly uncommon. </p>
        <p> Another grim hallmark of the Vault 87 experiments is the frequent presence of centaurs—grotesque amalgamations of flesh formed by uncontrolled mutation. Often found alongside super mutants, they serve as a reminder of the catastrophic failures of the program and the suffering it inflicted.  </p>
        <p> At present, the Vault 87 super mutants remain a largely irreconcilable force. Unlike other mutant populations, they show little interest in coexistence or reform, standing instead as a cautionary example of what occurs when forced evolution is pursued without restraint, oversight, or purpose. </p>
        <h3> Commonwealth </h3>
        <hr>
        <p> The super mutants found throughout the Commonwealth are the result of the Institute’s experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus, using a sample of unknown origin. These experiments were conducted as part of early research into synthetic humans, with exposed subjects later released into the wasteland once they were deemed failures. As a result, these mutants now exist as a widespread and persistent presence in the region. </p>
        <p> In appearance, they share the dark green skin common to older western strains, but their bodies develop differently. Muscle growth is often uneven and distorted, lacking the dense, defined structure seen elsewhere. Like the mutants of the Capital Wasteland, many continue to grow with age, becoming larger and less intelligent over time. This degeneration frequently culminates in behemoths—massive, unstable creatures that represent the extreme end of the Institute’s failed experimentation. </p>
        <p> Behavior among these super mutants is varied but largely aggressive. They form distinct tribes, establish camps, and display a crude sense of social hierarchy. While capable of speech and basic planning, their worldview is shaped by resentment. Many see themselves as superior to humans, viewing violence not merely as survival, but as justified retaliation for their own creation and suffering. </p>
        <p> Despite this hostility, not all Institute-created super mutants are irredeemable. A small number demonstrate restraint, curiosity, or even a desire to understand humanity. These rare individuals offer glimpses into mutant communal life and suggest that their aggression is learned or reinforced rather than entirely innate. </p>
        <p> They are rarely encountered alone. Mutant hounds and other FEV-altered creatures commonly accompany them, reinforcing the impression that the Institute’s work produced an entire ecosystem of unintended life. Among these creations, the Commonwealth strain is notable for one unprecedented development: the existence of a viable cure. A former Institute scientist successfully developed a serum capable of restoring his original human genetic structure, overwriting the effects of FEV entirely. </p>
        <p> At present, the Commonwealth super mutants stand as living evidence of experimentation without accountability. Unlike other strains, their condition is no longer strictly irreversible, raising difficult questions about responsibility, restitution, and whether some of these beings might yet reclaim the lives taken from them. </p>
        <h3> Appalachia </h3>
        <p> Appalachia features super mutants derived from pre-War FEV experiments at the West Tek research center in Appalachia, including mass exposure of the denizens of Huntersville and infection of survivors by the Appalachian Enclave under orders from President Thomas Eckhart, in a desperate bid to increase the DEFCON rating and gain access to the region's missile weapons. Widespread, violent, and hostile, these super mutants have a major presence in the region and are a common enemy for factions that inhabited Appalachia in the past (Responders and Elizabeth Taggerdy's Brotherhood) and those who have returned to it after the Scorched Plague - most importantly the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force under Paladin Leila Rahmani. After the war, their numbers were increased as a consequence of continued FEV experimentation by Dr. Edgar Blackburn and his colleagues. </p>
        <p> They share many traits with those seen in the Commonwealth, with no noticable difference between the two other than their place and time of origin. Most of them have the same dark green skin, oddly shaped muscles, and growth with age that those created by the Institute possess. However, there is one example of a super mutant in the region having different traits, as is the case with Dr. Blackburn. </p>

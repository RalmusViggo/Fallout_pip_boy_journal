<h1> Non-Feral Ghouls </h1>

<div class="container">
    <div class="text-block">
        <p> Ghouls are living creatures that have been mutated by exposure to radiation, rather than killed by it. This mutation process, referred to as ghoulification, has demonstrated different effects depending on the subject's species and their individual circumstances. In humans, ghoulification typically results in an extended lifespan (if not functional immortality), enhanced regeneration of wounds such that severed limbs can be reattached and maintain full function, and a natural immunity to physical damage from radiation exposure. Conversely, their condition renders them infertile and changes their appearance, described as resembling rotten flesh, burn victims, or walking corpses. </p>
        <p> As a result of their mutation, ghouls are commonly considered a separate species and unfortunately thus a frequent target of discrimination in the wasteland, especially in areas of dense human population. Many are driven to madness by their physical transformation and the suffering they endure because of it, becoming feral ghouls that have lost all sense of rationale and regressed to animalistic instinct, attacking any non-ghouls they come across. Many non-feral ghouls prefer to live in their own communities away from humanity, though will still refer to themselves as ghouls. Doc Barrows, a ghoul doctor and scientist from the ghoul settlement of Underworld in the Capital Wasteland, expresses preference for the term "necrotic post-humans" to refer to his own kind. Xenophobic rhetoric against ghouls has included the use of the word "zombie" as a pejorative referring to their appearance. </p>
        <p> Furthermore, the process of ghoulification, while most prominently displayed with humans, is not exclusive to them and has been observed in other species, such as bears and gorillas. </p>

        <h2> Background </h2>
        <p> The bulk of their population was created by the radiation unleashed during the Great War or exposure to high levels of radiation in subsequent generations. While certain pre-War researchers, such as Platt, theorized that radiation could lead to the evolution of mutants such as ghouls, they were generally not known to exist before the War. Pre-War media depicted creatures similar to ghouls, as well as a film that expressly named such creatures as "ghouls" rather than "zombies. </p>
        <p> Some individual ghouls did in fact exist before the Great War as a result of isolated medical experimentation. This allowed controlled exposure to radiation to ghoulify pre-War people identified as capable of going through such a change, first experimentally, then as a means of obtaining immortality and radiation immunity in anticipation of the new world. Beyond controlled irradiation, it is known that research was conducted to create a biochemical means of transformation; an unspecified company located in or near the Commonwealth of Massachusetts successfully created a one-of-a-kind "radiation drug" that could induce a state very similar to that of other cases of ghoulification, along with an intense psychedelic state as a side effect. By the mid-2280s, only one sample of this drug remained when it was acquired by John McDonough, who apparently learned of its existence and the effects it produces at some point and which inspired him to seek out and imbibe it out of emotional instability and self-hatred. John had deliberately sought to turn into a ghoul as a means of "reinventing" himself, before he later went on to take over the town of Goodneighbor as its mayor "John Hancock." </p>
        <h3> New California </h3>
        <p> In California, ghouls were the first group of survivors to begin rebuilding civilization; the survivors of Vault 12 beneath Bakersfield, who had been mutated into ghouls, founded Necropolis in the summer of 2083. Less than a year later, in 2084, Set wrested control of the settlement from the original overseer and instituted his own reign, characterized by delusions of grandeur. The city would eventually decline, starting with the attack by the Master's Unity in 2157, who expected to find an unopened Vault in the ruins of the city. After many ghouls were killed in the assault, Set negotiated peace with the super mutants after explaining that the ghouls were indeed the vault dwellers. The recovery operation failed, but the Unity established a stronghold in the town to ensure Set's cooperation and watch for humans. </p>
        <p> Necropolis would eventually be destroyed and most of its population killed in a retaliatory expedition by the super mutants, sent to the city after the Vault Dweller raided the Vault and recovered the water chip, eliminating the super mutant garrison in the process. This led to a great migration and the eventual founding of a number of ghoul and ghoul-friendly settlements, including Broken Hills in 2185, the NCR state of Dayglow around 2189, and Gecko in 2235. Though problems with equality in New California continued, ghouls were increasingly seen as equal members of society through the 23rd century, though their numbers steadily dwindled. </p>
        <p> In 2277, in the Divide, nuclear warheads triggered by the Courier's delivery of an automated nuclear launch device exploded and triggered rapid ghoulification of the Legion and NCR forces engaged in battle there. The Divide flayed them alive, causing them to become dead men walking, marked for death, sustained only by the intense radiation that permeates the area. As they never appear outside the Divide, due to the necessity of staying near radiation sources to remain alive, the marked men became a legend in the wasteland, like the Sierra Madre, the Burned Man or the Big Empty. </p>
        <p> In the Mojave Wasteland of 2281, ghouls can be found in small amounts throughout the region, but no town is completely dedicated to them. There are usually a few ghouls living among humans in various communities performing jobs in order to survive, such as the guard Beatrix Russell and the comedian Hadrian, both of which are in Freeside. The only known community of ghouls in the region is the Bright Brotherhood, a religious faction founded and led by an intelligent glowing one named Jason Bright, who has prophesied a land called the "Far Beyond" where the ghouls will be free from bigotry; they wish to use the rockets in the REPCONN test site to reach this land. There are also several ghoul rangers occupying Ranger Station Echo, implying some level of acceptance of ghouls serving in the NCR military. In contrast, Caesar's Legion does not allow ghouls (along with other mutants) within their ranks, but do allow ghouls to live in their territory, such as Raul Tejada, who traveled from Two-Sun to the Mojave. To Caesar, ghouls and other mutants are irrelevant to his plans to push westward due to their small population sizes. </p>
        <p> In the core of New California, attitudes towards ghouls may have deteriorated after the collapse of NCR governance in Los Angeles in the 2280s: the settlement of Filly was known to discriminate against ghouls, and ghouls were also preyed on by organ harvesters in the region. However, the NCR remnant settlement at Griffith Observatory continued to accept ghoul inhabitants. </p>
        <h3> East Coast </h3>
        <p> The densely urbanized East had a great concentration of American population and was strongly affected by the nuclear fallout. People who took shelter in affected areas experienced radiation poisoning; those who did not die became ghouls. Within a year, the first ghouls began to appear and with them, the first fledgling settlements, like Underworld in Washington, D.C., which existed as late as 2277. Although in areas like Appalachia, ghouls were quickly sought out and exterminated, no matter what relation they may have had with others before they became ghouls. Another population of ghouls, transformed Chinese operatives stranded on American soil, chose to sequester themselves from the wasteland at Mama Dolce's. </p>
        <p> In other areas, like the Commonwealth, ghouls cohabited with humans. The most noticeable example was Diamond City. Ghouls were a part of the city's population from its foundation in the 2130s to the 2282 election. Diamond City was gripped by a wave of racism, thanks to a candidate by the name of McDonough. He ran for the city's mayor on the Mankind for McDonough platform and won the election thanks to the votes of the Upper Stands citizens. After his election, ghoul citizens were evicted. Entire families were thrown out of the city by their human neighbors, straight into the surrounding ruins to perish without a cap to their name. Those that survived scattered across the region. A refugee called Wiseman founded the Slog, the foremost tarberry farm in the Commonwealth. Many found refuge in the settlement of Goodneighbor. </p>
        <h3> Appalachia </h3>
        <p> After the War, a pre-War mall known as Valley Galleria became a haven for ghouls in Appalachia, referred to by survivors as "the Changed." Led by Lucy Harwick, ghouls sheltering in the Galleria welcomed others like them to travel there and be accepted with "open arms, and more importantly, open hearts." However, because of his experiences with feral ghouls, Duncan McKann would murder Lucy Harwick and several others in a single-minded pursuit for revenge, eliminating one of the only havens before human extinction in the region due to the Scorched Plague at the turn of the century. The only known survivors of this community were ones who split off from the group when McKann began hunting them: Elmira, Maddox Mullen and Kevan Asherton chose to head east instead of following the group, forming a gang of survivalist raiders known as the Revenants in order to survive. Although Elmira died during a raid, the rest of the group were able to take refuge in a former nuclear silo in the far north of Appalachia, where they have lived as isolationist survivalists (and occasionally, raiders) ever since. </p>
        <p> Due to persecution by humans, many ghouls organized and made an expedition to the Capital Wasteland prior to 2102 to join a settlement of other ghouls. </p>
        <p> After the mass migration and resettlement of Appalachia in 2103, ghouls returned alongside other humans, working with them to rebuild. Some examples include Eugenie, who worked for the Blue Ridge Caravan Company as a guard. Mordecai McCoy found steady work entering radioactive areas to scavenge goods and a general handyman around The Wayward. Gunther Jenkins and Betty Hill worked for Patricia Myers at Nuka-World on Tour. However, due to the prevalence of ferals, ghouls still faced discrimination. Two of Appalachia's main settlements, Foundation and the Crater, had their own reasons; the Settlers came from the destroyed northwest and accordingly had a shoot on sight policy (which would be readily amended once a ghoul was identified as sentient, which would require one to mask up to enter the town). The Crater Raiders were more open on account of Lucky Lou, but he had to deal with Lev's enmity; the Russian raider despised Lou and manipulated him into suicide attempts, taunting him by suggesting that he'd inevitably go feral. </p>
        <p> One of the largest concentration of ghouls in Appalachia was not American, but Chinese. Unlike the Morgantown facility, infiltrators based in the Deep escaped the notice of Enclave forces in the Whitespring bunker. Despite surviving the War in the cave system beneath Whitespring, they underwent ghoulification, allowing them to continue Operation Trinitite indefinitely, operating in hostile territory with no hope of resupply. These communist soldiers remained loyal to the People's Liberation Army, in particular due to the influence of a pre-War commander as loyal as they were terrifying. Despite being trapped thousands of miles away from home, they continued their mission to acquire the Motherlode mining robot, presumably to tunnel into the Whitespring bunker and capture it for the People's Republic of China. The mission was ongoing as of 2103, though with limited success. </p>
        <p> Another community of ghouls formed in Vault 63, stretching beneath the Skyline Valley region. The Vault was left unfinished by the time of the Great War, which resulted in many of its inhabitants dying from radiation poisoning and the rest being turned to ghouls. As the single largest ghoul community in Appalachia, it has suffered greatly from the issue of feralization, focusing research on trying to find a cure. Due to a lack of success, many of the dwellers were either sedated or put in a state of suspended animation. Hower, feralization soon became a secondary concern. The pride of the Vault's overseer, Hugo Stolz, has led to the emergence of the Lost, a unique ghoul variant formed by a combination of ghoulification and weather experiments conducted in Skyline Valley. Circumstances in 2105 resulted in the Lost breaking through to the surface when they had previously been kept contained, creating a new threat to the people of Appalachia, and the Vault 76 dwellers had to work with the leaders of Vault 63 to address the threat. </p>
        <p> In 2105, the Vault Dwellers began to interact with the Revenants, the isolationist ghoul community founded by survivors of Lucy Harwick's group. With their efforts to conceal their identities, they have developed a reputation as masked bandits, and incidents of violence from their members have led outsiders to brand them as a raider gang. While members freely admit they have engaged in raids, they are more focused on survival and self-preservation, rather than wanton cruelty, and they have also been spreading rumors of a radiation specialist at their facility to attract new ghouls. Parthenia Blankenship, the Revenants' aforementioned radiation specialist, had developed a concoction taken through inhalation that, when combined with radiation, can transform humans into ghouls. </p>
        <hr>
        <h2> Biology </h2>
        <p> Ghouls are created when a human with a compatible biology is exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation of the right type (eg. gamma radiation) and in the correct amount. Precisely what determines which humans undergo ghoulification is not known, even centuries after the Great War. Many people who suffer radiation poisoning die a horrifying death due to a combination of violent hemorrhaging and widespread necrosis. Ghouls suffer the same effects, but also develop a mutation that results in super-powered regeneration of their bodies, allowing them to survive damage that would kill regular humans. This also results in their monstrous appearance; exposure to radiation still damages their bodies, leading to exposed muscle, flaking skin, and damaged connective tissue, including the loss of nose and ears. </p>
        <p> The more violent the exposure, the worse the effects; ghouls who are created as a result of surviving nuclear blasts will usually be twisted by burns and other damage caused by the explosion, resulting in a generally much more horrifying appearance, with exposed bone, asymmetric deformations, and extensive, seemingly rotting wounds. he actual transformation can take anywhere from hours, to weeks, to as much as a year or longer, depending on exposure levels. Age is also a non-factor, as people with the capacity to become a ghoul can change from as early as childhood into old age. </p>
        <p> Although some ghouls were born before the War, the majority of ghouls were created by the Great War and resulting exposure to nuclear blasts or nuclear fallout, with some created over the subsequent centuries by exposure to high levels of radiation; for example, at Camp Searchlight in 2281, an attack resulted in the town becoming blanketed by intense radiation, turning a majority of the NCR troopers stationed there into ghouls. Camp Searchlight also demonstrated the role of trauma in the effects of the transformation; it can cause a mental breakdown in the victim, causing a rapid degeneration of higher thought processes, and leading them to become feral. Particularly severe irradiation can lead to the creation of glowing ones. </p>
        <p> in contrast, controlled mutation can result in a much better survival rate. Controlled irradiation still damages the appearance, but doesn't seem to trigger the risk of going feral. Biochemical means allow for the preservation of a ghoul's appearance, at least in the short term. An experimental radiation drug can trigger rapid mutation in a human, but without changing their appearance. However, the accumulating damage will change the ghoul's appearance over time, especially as the regeneration overcorrects and leads to scarring and other cosmetic damage. However, this does depend on the type of the drug. </p>

        <h4 class="fh"> Non-human ghouls </h4>
        <p> Ghoulification is not unique to humans and is a possible mutation for various families of animals. Animal ghouls seem to share all the disadvantages and advantages of becoming a ghoul as a human does, this includes rapid hair loss, the deterioration of the epidermis, severe cataracts and glaucoma of the eyes, elongated life-spans, as well as transforming into glowing ones through extended exposure to radiation. </p>
        <p> Examples of affected species can be found throughout post-War America from New California to the East Coast. Known pre-War individuals include Ruzka, a circus bear that was performing around the Point Lookout area, and the Beast of Beckley, a legendary wolf known to roam Appalachia. Roaming alpha mongrels can also be found to be wearing dog collars from their previous domesticated lives. Even non-native species such as gorillas may become ghoulified. It is also believed by some caravan guards that ghoulified blue whales exist. </p>

    <div class="text-block">
        <h3> Extended lifespan </h3>
        <p> Due to a mutation within the autonomic nervous system following exposure to gamma radiation in specific combinations (technically, ionizing radiation with wavelengths below ten picometers), the normal process of decay in the neurotransmitters along the spinal cord is disrupted. The effect of the mutation is an extended lifespan. Ghouls can be considered functionally immortal, as unless they are killed due to violence or in accidents, they can live for centuries. A significant number of ghouls remains alive as late as 2296, nearly 220 years after the Great War, though many run the risk of feralization. </p>
        <p> As ghouls retain their normal cognition and are generally no different than humans in terms of intellect, many ghouls benefit from their extreme lifespan and are capable of amassing skill and knowledge far beyond the ability of regular humans, especially when they combine their original skills or education with this experience;  The Ghoul <sub> (The Ghoul, born Cooper Howard, Once a famous Hollywood actor in the pre-War era, after the bombs fell, he was transformed into a ghoul, spending centuries fighting and killing in the wasteland as a bounty hunter) </sub> combines his Marine training with two hundred years of working as a bounty hunter. </p>
        <h3> Supercharged regeneration </h3>
        <p> The mutation also greatly increases the regeneration rate of the ghoul body, allowing it to heal even the most complicated wounds, such as a foot crushed to a pulp by a power armor's foot, and even lethal injuries like an arrow to the neck, as long as the nervous system remains intact. The altered ghoul physiology is boosted in the presence of radiation, resulting in a rate of regeneration pushed even further. Ghouls may still use stimpaks for healing, but regular medical care combined with their natural regeneration makes them optional. In theory, a ghoul could survive anywhere. However, ghoul regeneration cannot heal all conditions: for example, Hugo Stolz, who was born blind, remained blind after becoming a ghoul.  </p>
        <p> Regardless, the regeneration is strong enough to allow for lost body parts to be reattached even long after they were removed from the ghoul. Once fixed in place, the ghoul's body will simply regenerate the tissue and restore functionality. While a medical professional is usually preferred, even simple needle and thread is enough to ensure a lost finger will knit itself back with a ghoul's hand. Ghoul organs may even be compatible with regular humans due to this regeneration, leading to some being captured, sold, and slaughtered for their organs. </p>
        <p> The regenerative effect of ghoulification also allows for further mutations and changes to occur. The marked men of the Divide became sustained by radiation, allowing them to survive being flayed alive by Divide storms, but without descending into a feral state. An even more dramatic change occurred when the ghoul residents of Vault 63 were exposed to the meteorological experiments of Hugo Stolz; rather than being killed by striking lightning, their altered physiology allowed them to contain the energy of the lightning, permanently trapping it within their bodies. This changed them on a fundamental level, causing them to perceive the world as pulses and wavelengths. While this has restored a form of eyesight for Hugo Stolz, other victims were rendered psychotic, likely as a result of the mental stress of their altered worldview and the pain of the electricity they were charged with. </p>
        <h3> Immunity to radiation and disease </h3>
        <p> Ghouls are immune to the direct degenerative effects of radiation, allowing them to stride through even the most intense pockets of radiation without issue (although it is considered a possible risk factor in feralization). This does not mean radiation doesn't affect them; ghouls still accumulate it and may even begin to glow at sufficient concentrations. Glowing ghouls directly experience radiation as warmth, and lower levels of background radiation are considered chilly, with some joking they may develop frostbite. </p>
        <p> A ghoul is also immune to most common diseases that affect unmutated humans. However, that doesn't mean ghouls are immune to all diseases, and diseases of the mind (not just feralization) can still affect a ghoul. </p>
        <p> An indirect benefit is that ghouls have no need for most medicine, especially Rad-X and RadAway, allowing them to freely use such goods for trade or payment for services rendered. </p>
        <h3> Food and water consumption </h3>
        <p> Ghouls' mutated physiology still requires them to provide adequate nourishment for their body, especially water and food. The loss of smellallows ghouls to eat food humans would consider repulsive, which, coupled with the resilience of their digestive tract, allows them to subsist on any edible items. The ability to ignore taste resulted in some ghouls engaging in cannibalism, consuming the flesh of other humans and even ghouls, with one of these being the Ghoul's "ass jerky." <sub> i didn't get this ignorance of taste... but i <i> have</i> experimented a little... his jerky isn't as tasty as fresh flesh... </sub> </p>
        <p> However, their mutated physiologies have drawbacks; recreational drugs like Jet have a diminished effect on their physiology, requiring double doses or increased potency to work. The neurotransmitters that would be firing at an accelerated rate during the use of a drug like Jet in a normal human would be quickly dealt with in the ghoul's body. </p>
        <p> There are exceptions to the need for food and water; the regenerative properties of ghouls' mutated bodies can sustain them in the absence of either. While this is consistent with feral ghouls, who are technically dead, sustained only by radiation, there have been four confirmed cases of ghouls over nearly 220 years after the Great War, who experienced deprivation of food, water and even air for extended periods of time and came out no worse for the wear. </p>
        <p> The precise reasons for this ability are not understood, but they may be connected to a form of hibernation. </p>
        <hr>
        <h2> Complications </h2>
        <h3> Appearance </h3>
        <p> A significant drawback of ghoulification is the changes in appearance. Ghouls are disfigured by radiation, at a rate influenced largely by the manner of their exposure; the more radiation received in a short amount of time, the more drastic the changes. Outward symptoms of ghoulification are more gradual with chronic exposure. In general, ghouls experience loss of skin and connective tissue in a manner similar to leprosy. Their outward appearance may end up looking like a noseless mutant with skin resembling tanned leather, a burn victims, or a rotting zombie with exposed muscle, blood vessels, and in extreme cases even bone and internal organs. </p>
        <p> Ghouls frequently vary in appearance between regions. Some are more grotesque, with rotting and missing parts and melted skin (such as the case with Set <sub> (the first leader of necropolis) </sub>); others have patches of skin missing with what remains being leathery and/or patchy, as with many seen in the Mojave and the Capital Wasteland. Some also have more wrinkled skin whereas others appear more burned, as seen in the Commonwealth and Appalachia. In unique cases, the skin can be flayed off or have glowing elements such as with the glowing ones or the Lost, and in rare cases some ghouls may appear smooth. Ghouls' body color can vary from light to dark and in some cases glowing, and their eye color can also range between black, faded or hazy, red, and in some rare cases <sub> (such as with me) </sub> glowing. Ghouls generally lose hair along with the skin, though this varies due to the unpredictable nature of the change. Some may retain their head and facial hair, even allowing it to be stylized. It is also possible that some retain their hair only for it to gradually fall out over time. The loss of the nose in particular greatly limits their ability to experience smell. The lose of their noses is a trait all ghouls seem to share. </p>
        <p> Vocal cords and the larynx are also usually affected by the change, resulting in a raspy voice; though again, this varies, such as the vocal cords experiencing only minor degradation when ghoulification begins, resulting in a far less raspy voice, compared to those who have experienced it for far longer. It is also possible that some ghouls start out with less raspy voices only for that to change over time. It appears that a ghoul's pre-transformation occupation and its impact on their health may play a role, as performers like Cooper Howard or Dean Domino retained mastery of their voices without significant degradation. </p>
        <h3> Health issues </h3>
        <p> Other results of the change are widespread necrosis, rot, and other degenerative conditions like arthritis, cataracts, and glaucoma. Feralization and dementia can happen immediately. In fact, this necrosis can be exacerbated by a phenomenon whereby rotting flesh around sweat glands exudes macronutrients, which attract flies that further digest and consume the tissue of the ghoul. </p>
        <h3> Feralization </h3>
        <p> The greatest complication a ghoul can experience is feralization, described by Barrows as ferocious post-necrotic dystrophy. This process results in the atrophying of higher mental functions, leading to an irreversible degeneration into a feral creature that attacks living beings on sight, with the sole exception of other ghouls, feral or not. The mechanism of degeneration is a degeneration of brain functions (which is affected by standard regeneration, but not the mutation of the spinal cord) and their atrophy, leading to an increased level of aggression and appetite. When the loss of capacity for thought is complete, a ghoul becomes feral. The long-term effects destroy the body, which may alternatively bloat or waste away, as a feral ghoul no longer experiences normal physiological processes, sustained entirely by accumulated radiation. As a result, they emit no body heat and take on ambient temperature. </p>
        <p> While the mechanism of feralization is well understood, the precise factors that cause it are not. This has been a problem for ghouls over the centuries, with numerous attempts to figure out a way to prevent feralization or cure it once symptoms of its onset were identified. If possible, ghouls were placed in suspended animation pending research. isk factors that may increase the rate of a ghoul going feral include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Social isolation: Anti-social or isolated ghouls are more susceptible to it, however, even communities of ghouls may succumb to it. Several examples of individuals living in groups yet still transforming include the co-workers and partner of Oswald Oppenheimer, while he himself did not transform. The crew of Captain Zao succumbed to turning feral aboard the Yangtze while the captain retained his faculties. </li>
            <li> Lack of focus or poor mental state: Ghouls of exceptional willpower or with an intense focus may retain their faculties, even if others around them succumb to feralization. Likewise, the trauma of ghoulification can cause a mental breakdown in the victim, causing a rapid degeneration of higher thought processes, causing them to become feral. Highly intelligent individuals and highly motivated ones may also experience lower risk of feralization. </li>
            <li> Exposure to intense radiation: While ghouls are immune to radiation, extensive exposure may contribute to the degeneration of mental state, if not directly affecting the brain matter. </li>
            <li> Individual genetic factors: Some ghouls may also be simply immune to feralization; despite being one of the most dangerous and single-minded ghouls in existence, The Ghoul still started manifesting symptoms of feralization. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> In Appalachia in the early 22nd century, a chem called "The Fix" was used to prevent ghouls from becoming feral. By the late 23rd century, a drug was created that allowed ghouls to stop the degenerative processes. Administered orally, the drug would immediately bring the ghoul back to their normal self. Properly medicated, a ghoul can live for decades with access to the medication. However, it is both expensive and rare, in particular in New California after the fall of Shady Sands. Isolated groups have continued to manufacture it in limited quantities, and making bank on desperate ghouls in the absence of law and order. A ghoulification serum, or "elixir," shared the same appearance with the contents of the inhaler vials, and may be connected to ghouls in some fashion. </p>
        <h3> Glowing </h3>
        <p> The transformation of a ghoul into a glowing one (luminous necrotic post-human), occurs when the organism of a ghoul ceases filtering radioactive particles from the blood, resulting in bioaccumulation and the gradual appearance of bioluminescence as a result. Luminous ghouls are usually feral, due to the damage to their nervous system and the time it takes to accumulate the radiation, though ghouls may develop luminescence before degenerating into a beast-like state, like Jason Bright and Oswald Oppenheimer... and if i'm exposed to more radiation, me. </p>
        <h3> Sterility </h3>
        <p> Ghouls retain their genitals, which includes the penis and testicles in male ghouls. They also retain their sex drive and capacity for engaging in intercourse and some humans have a ghoul fetish. However, ghouls are sterile and cannot procreate like humans. Any children they may have are either adopted or were mutated into ghouls alongside their parents. </p>
        <p> This was well known, and formed a basis for the religious tale of Saint Monica, reported to be an unmutated child of ghoul parents. </p>
        <hr>
        <h2> Discrimination </h2>
        <p> One of the biggest hinderances to having a healthy mind is the discrimintation ghouls face from smoothskins, aka humans. </p>

        <p> * I feel somewhat... no i do feel bad for these lost souls, once human, but driven mad. All non-feral ghouls struggle with going feral, often through chems, since it is one of the only truly viable method to avoid going feral. * </p>
        <p> Feral ghouls (also known as mindless zombies, ghoul crazies, feral necrotic post-humans, zombies or simply ferals) are a portion of ghouls that have lost their upper faculties and ability to reason, regressing into basic instinct and behaving more like vicious wild animals attacking any non-ghouls they encounter regardless of former ties like friends or family. Much of the xenophobic prejudice against ghoulkind by humans is due to the widespread assumption that becoming feral is an inevitable outcome for all ghouls, causing them to be shunned from human settlements and left on the fringes of post-War society. </p>

        <h2> Research Findings </h2>

        <h3> Biology </h3>
        <hr class="short">
        <p> The degeneration into a feral state (referred to as ferocious post-necrotic dystrophy) is not fully understood. It is known that it is a result of a degeneration of the brain (which is not affected by the regenerative mutation of the spinal cord) and emerges following the atrophy of higher brain functions, accompanied by an increased level of aggression and appetite. When the loss of capacity for thought is complete, a ghoul is considered feral. The factors that may cause a ghoul to enter this state are unclear, but anti-social or isolated ghouls may be more susceptible to it. Exposure to intense radiation may also be a factor; feral ghouls have no body heat and emit lethal levels of radiation, indicating that feral ghouls are for all intents and purposes dead, their functions sustained only by their high irradiation. This allows them to survive for centuries, relying only on the energy provided by radiation, at the expense of a horrifying, emaciated appearance. The process is irreversible. </p>
        <p> Feral ghouls seem to vary in appearance between regions. Some ferals look exactly the same as they did before turning feral with no visible alterations, especially when they have only recently gone feral, but most go through many physical changes over time. Some such as the ones seen in the Capital Wasteland and the Mojave, have clouded eyes and are skinny with many of their bones showing as if large parts of them had fallen off. The ones seen in areas like the Commonwealth and Appalachia are less skeletal in appearance and more deformed and husk like, with some being bloated and having large growths on their bodies. In both cases, their bodies can vary in color, with some being lighter and others darker. Glowing ones also tend to be significantly more common among ferals compared to non-ferals, with most of them glowing a bright green, though other colors have rarely been seen. </p>

        <h3> Behavior </h3>
        <p> Feral ghouls have generally apparently lost all capacity to reason. They are thought to be driven purely by what remains of their survival instincts, clustering in groups and attacking whatever disturbs them with relentless fury. When provoked, they all rush the source of the disturbance, usually a living creature from the wasteland, and try to attack using their limbs. The degeneration of the central nervous system means they cannot use tools (unless recently ghoulified), though it also means they will attack with full force, without the natural human limiters on muscle use. Ghouls will call out to other ferals with a screech, typically causing the entire pack to swarm the target. </p>
        <p> Feral ghouls often cluster together in dark, cool environments, like sub-basement-levels or underground areas, only occasionally leaving their normal hunting grounds. However, the myth that ferals fear light is false, as many ferals may be encountered out in the open during the day or in otherwise well-lit areas. </p>
        <p> Frequently, ferals of all types will wander from place to place, occasionally suffering from clonic seizures and stopping at fallen prey to feed, but will immediately attack any and all non-ghoul creatures they come across. On occasion, they have even been known to attack non-feral ghouls, especially those who are close to going feral themselves. They will often sniff, screech or lash out at other ferals. Upon detecting a non-ghoul, most ferals will make a high-pitched gurgle or screech, setting out to search the area. Upon sighting prey, they will often scream once more, alerting any nearby ghouls and attack. There is no rank or pecking order to these attacks; all attack at the same time in a rampant onslaught. Because of this, in enclosed areas like Vault 34, it is very easy to get overwhelmed. Feral ghouls mainly attack with their hands, slashing and smashing in an insane fury. Some feral ghouls can be seen to use weapons, such as the trooper ghouls in Camp Searchlight, likely indicating that they have only gone feral recently. </p>
        <p> Ferals have also been shown to possess a sense of self-preservation, as one known occasion they actively fled a Brotherhood of Steel onslaught. In the same locale, a cluster of ferals was kept relatively docile when fed regularly. </p>
        <p> An Enclave officer once encountered a group of docile feral ghouls and captured one for study after it followed him to base. Ethyl, Meat, Atom's Champion and the Sun of Atom are nonverbal ghouls with the appearance of "feral ghouls" who live peacefully among their communities. </p>

        <h3> Ghoul mask </h3>
        <p> One interesting note on ferals is that they seem to be fooled by very rudimentary means. The ghoul mask, seemingly nothing more than the hollowed-out head of a ghoul or several pieces of a human/ghoul head sutured together, still seems to deter ferals from attacking. </p>
        <p> When wearing the ghoul mask (or using a Stealth Boy) i found that i could observe relaxed feral ghouls' actions, including twitching, bending down, having fits or sniffing the air. If one is wearing the ghoul mask, ferals will often turn their head to the side and stretch their necks when nearing them, as if they are confused. </p>
        <p> Roy Phillips, who originally possesses the mask, states if one gets too close to the ghouls, they will "sniff" the mask wearer out and attack, even with the mask on. Regardless of this advice, the ghouls will not attack unless one removes the mask or provokes them with hostile action. </p>

        <h3> Feral ghoul </h3>
        <hr class="short">
        <p> Feral ghouls (also known as mindless ghouls, ghoul crazies or zombies) are the basic feral ghoul variant, wearing only a pair of tattered shorts and noticeably weaker than standard humans, they are easily dispatched with one or two headshots from any decent weapon or a solid hit from a decent melee or unarmed weapon. Despite their shrill noise and remarkable speed, they are only truly a threat when they have the advantage of numbers, or when you are unprepared. Some feral ghouls come in different colors as well as different types. The colors are different depending on how the human looked before turning into a feral ghoul. </p>

        <h3> Feral ghoul roamer </h3>
        <p> Some feral ghoul roamers in the Capital Wasteland wear what appears to be the remains of old combat armor, and are somewhat tougher than standard feral ghouls, requiring more damage to be dealt to put them down. However, in the Mojave Wasteland, ghoul roamers appear no different than the standard feral ghoul. They are not very common but can be found in groups of up to five in places containing lots of ghouls, like the Museum of History. </p>

        <h3> Feral ghoul reaver </h3>
        <p> They are much more combat-worthy than other ghouls and wear what appears to be the remnants of metal armor. They also have the ability to rip radioactive gore out of themselves and hurl it like a grenade. Aside from the damage they can inflict, they also have great endurance and is one of the most resilient creatures i've met, being able to survive even attacks from the Fat Man. Their lunge attacks (much like a deathclaw) can send anyone a good distance back, and can even cripple or kill a powerful combatant very quickly. </p>
        <p> Even at point-blank range the V.A.T.S. chance for hitting a reaver's head will never go above 74% </p>
        <p> It is safe to say that these ghouls are terrifying. </p>

        <h3> Charred feral ghoul </h3>
        <p> The charred ghouls, much like the reavers, are One of the strongest variants of feral ghouls, these ghoul are covered by a thick layer of rust, giving it a natural armor and drastically increasing its resistance to damage. </p>
        <p> It is safe to say that these ghouls are also terrifying. </p>

        <h3> Fog ghoul </h3>
        <p> This variant of ghoul only found on the Island and mutated as a result of the Island's radioactive fog. Fog ghouls are much paler than their more common brethren found in the Commonwealth, with black burns on certain parts of their skin and fishing nets draped over their chest. Their eye sockets are quite large, with the eyes sunken in, and their teeth are permanently gritted, exposing the gums, which seem inflamed, and the teeth sunk in as well. Black soot is also smeared across their faces. </p>

        <h3> Swamp ghoul </h3>
        <p> Swamp ghouls are feral ghouls that exclusively inhabit the swamps of Point Lookout. Swamp ghouls wear tattered shorts similar to those commonly worn by tribals. They are found in large numbers in and around the Turtledove Detention Camp. They exhibit characteristics similar to those of normal feral ghouls, but their skin's general appearance is more of a gray color and they are also considerably weaker. However, the swamp ghouls tend to appear in greater numbers than their Capital Wasteland counterparts. </p>

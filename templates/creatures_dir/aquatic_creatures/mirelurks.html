        <h1> Mirelurks </h1>
        <hr>
        <p> Mirelurk is a commonly used term referring to a range of mutated aquatic species endemic to the Eastern Seaboard, particularly the Capital Wasteland, the Commonwealth and Appalachia. </p>
        <p> A similar term, lakelurk, is used to refer to species in the Colorado watershed in the Mojave Wasteland. </p>
        <h2> Mirelurks — Field Journal Entry </h2>
        <hr>
        <p> Mirelurks are among the most pervasive aquatic mutants encountered today, thriving in polluted rivers, coastal waters, and flooded urban spaces. Their presence is a direct legacy of severe environmental contamination caused by pre-collapse industrial activity, particularly the unchecked discharge of radioactive and chemical waste into marine ecosystems. Early warning signs were documented by oceanographic and environmental groups, who observed abnormal growth rates and rising biomass in crustacean populations shortly before ecological collapse. These warnings went unheeded, and the resulting strain on food chains led to rapid die-offs and instability—conditions that set the stage for extreme mutation. </p>
        <p> In the aftermath of widespread radiation exposure, surviving marine arthropods underwent profound and chaotic changes. Modern mirelurks appear to be composite organisms, bearing anatomical traits of multiple unrelated species. The common “crab” mirelurk, for example, displays characteristics of both horseshoe crabs and true crabs, defying conventional biological classification. As a result, many researchers treat mirelurks as a distinct genus entirely, commonly referred to as Scylla serrata horrendus—a name reflecting both their monstrous nature and serrated carapace. Oral tradition persists that these creatures were once far smaller and less aggressive before mutation took hold. </p>

        <p> Behaviorally, mirelurks are highly territorial and reproduce rapidly. They mature in a matter of weeks and lay eggs in numerous small nests scattered through shallow water, rather than carrying them as many ancestral species did. Disturbing these nests is extremely dangerous: larvae are immediately hostile and capable of coordinated attacks. Mirelurks also exhibit an unusual sensitivity to certain sound frequencies, particularly harsh or irregular noise, which can disorient or agitate them. </p>
        <p> Despite their danger, mirelurks play a significant role in the modern wasteland economy. Their meat, though notoriously tough and rubbery, is considered a delicacy and commands high prices. This has led to organized hunting—and in some cases, attempts at containment or domestication—though competition over the trade is fierce and often violent. Conversely, mirelurks pose a serious threat to permanent settlements, where infestations can persist despite regular extermination efforts, especially when nests are hidden beneath structures or in submerged ruins. </p>
        <p> In short, mirelurks are both a symptom and a reminder of environmental collapse: resilient, profitable, dangerous, and deeply entrenched in the ecosystems—and societies—that exist today. </p>
        <h2> Variants and Biology </h2>
        <hr>
        <p> The social structure of mirelurk species resembles a caste system, with intelligent mirelurk kings and the giant mirelurk queens at the top </p>
        <h3> Normal Mirelurks </h3>
        <p> One of the most common variants of the mirelurk, Scylla serrata horrendus is the result of mixing between horseshoe and blue crabs</p>
        <p> Their most noticeable feature is the large, chitinous shell that provides excellent resistance to firearms, melee weapons, and even ray guns. Soft body parts, such as their faces and sections of their abdomen, are much less resistant. </p>
        <p> Crab mirelurks instinctively know how to protect themselves with their shell. When faced with prey that can attack them at long range, a crab mirelurk will lower its head to cover its body with the chitinous shell, greatly increasing its ability to survive. Other animals tend to avoid mirelurks, perhaps instinctively realizing the danger posed by their shell. </p>
        <p> When hunting, mirelurks rely on their extraordinary sense of smell, with their poor eyesight a secondary aid. They catch their prey with their primary large claws. Once immobilized, abdominal claws strip the helpless prey as it is consumed down to the bone within minutes. </p>
        <p> Aside from their formidable claws, the number of limbs are variable - individuals seen around the Capital Wasteland and Colorado River are bipedal, while those seen around Boston and Appalachia are quadrupedal. </p>

        <h3> Mirelurk Hunters </h3>
        <p> Hunters appear to be descended from lobsters rather than crabs, giving them an elongated appearance with a flared tail. Like their crab-like cousins, they also have powerful pincers and are even more aggressive. Their shells are typically more resilient, and they have developed the ability to spit an acidic substance at their prey. The most characteristic elements of this kind of mirelurk are the oversized claws and its head, housing the eyes and antennae, its primary sensory organs. </p>
        <p> Although they lack the protection of their crab cousins, lobster mirelurks make up for it with their more powerful melee strikes and the ability to spit corrosive acid at targets </p>
        <p> In the Capital Wasteland and Mojave, where these creatures aren't present, the term "Hunter" is generally used to denote stronger crab based mirelurks. </p>

        <h3> Mirelurk King </h3>
        <p> Mirelurk kings have distinct adaptations to its water-rich environment, with pronounced webbed extremities and numerous fins all over its body. Their coloration is also red, rather than the typical blue, and possess a defining "crowned and mantle" appearance. They also have the ability to cloak themselves in order to ambush unsuspecting prey. They also uniquely possess both gills and lungs that were developed independently, allowing kings to survive on both land and water easily. </p>
        <p> Mirelurk kings appear humanoid in shape, but have evolved from radiation and are distinctly non-sapien in their evolution. The upper and lower fins developed into jointed claws that can grab or slash, as well as flex 180 degrees. The evolutionary line of the mirelurk kings is completely separate from the crab-based mirelurks. Having developed independently, the intelligence of mirelurk kings is much higher than crab mirelurks and a symbiotic relationship formed from mirelurk kings where they developed an ability to control the less-intelligent mirelurks. </p>

        <h3> Snapping turtle variant (reptilian mirelurk kings) </h3>
        <p> The reptilian mirelurk kings, standing upright on two feet, are the most human-like of the mirelurks. They have a symbiotic relationship with the other mirelurk types and commonly employ ranged attacks. The mirelurk king lacks the characteristic shell of other mirelurk variants but makes up for it with their thick, leathery skin, powerful arms and legs, and the ability to shriek at their attackers. This sonic attack is particularly dangerous against unaware or weakened targets. The swamplurk queen, found in Point Lookout, is highly adapted to its swampy environment. It is coated in a layer of algae which provides a degree of natural camouflage, and has the ability to spit corrosive, radioactive acid at its prey. Endemic to Lake Mead and the Colorado River is the lakelurk. They have a distinct, green coloration and the usual sonic attack. </p>
        <h3> Lakelurks </h3>
        <p> While technically not a mirelurk, they share many similarities to the Capital Wasteland's mirelurk kings. </p>
        <p> Lakelurks are mutated, bipedal creatures that live close to bodies of water such as Lake Mead, the Colorado River, the Camp Guardian caves, Blue Paradise Vacation Rentals, and Ruby Hill Mine. They are extremely territorial and aggressive, attacking almost anything that comes near them or their nests. They mainly attack by using a shrieking sonic pulse that stuns enemies and allows the lakelurk to get in close and rip them apart using their claws. </p>
        <p> Although lakelurks have a similar physical appearance to the mirelurk kings found in the Capital Wasteland, there is no evidence that lakelurks are capable of forming symbiotic relationships with other aquatic species. </p>
        <p> They are usually found in small groups of two to three, though they can occasionally be found in larger groups comprised of around five to eight. They have a high Perception, which makes them very quick to find potential prey within their immediate area. </p>

        <h3> Mirelurk hatchling/spawn </h3>
        <p> Hatchlings are the collective term for mirelurk young. Mirelurks lay eggs, often in a well-protected nest. Occasionally when a nest is disturbed, eggs will hatch in response to the stimuli. Hatchlings are easy to dispatch by a competent individual providing the swarm isn't large. At this stage, their shells are soft, and they are around the size of a radroach </p>

        <h3> Mirelurk queens </h3>
        <p> The mirelurk queen is a towering, heavily mutated, variant of the basic species. She is significantly taller than her standard counterparts and she maintains features from both mirelurks and hunters, such as the classic lobsteresque tail and the chitious shell on the top, to protect her from incoming damage. They are often spotted close to rivers, lakes or the seaside, where they lay their eggs, and are extremely territorial, aggressive, and protective their spawn; which they can also prematurely release from their abdomens to harass incoming threats in dire circumstances. </p>
        <p> They are extremely resilient and can withstand prolonged damage to a great deal of their body, bar a few vulnerable areas. Their eight powerful legs allow them to push their weight forward, gaining speed before an attack, and heir claws have mutated into scythe-like arms. Furthermore, they also produce a highly corrosive acid that they can spray out with great velocity; this acid is capable of causing damage through all available armor types. </p>

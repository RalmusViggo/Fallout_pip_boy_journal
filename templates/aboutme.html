<h1> About me and my journal. </h1>

<div class="container">
    <div class="text-block">
        <p> My name is <span class="redacted"> Mark</span> <span class="redacted"> Schultz</span>. I am often called "The Chronicler". </p>
        <p> I started writing this journal in the year 2163. I began writing it because I was so very fascinated by how humans and other creatures have adapted to the radioactive wasteland that is the world. </p>
        <p> As you might have been able to pice together if you've read some of my entries, I am far above the age of really any human, and this is because I am a ghoul. </p>
        <p> The current year as of when I'm writing this is 2287. So I am 148 years as of when I'm writing this. </p>
        <p> This journal is a guide of sorts I've made, I am... or was (depending on if I'm still in ownership of this pip-boy) hoping to make this a replicable holotape, so it can be widely distributed. </p>
